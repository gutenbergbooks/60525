<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> a certain day in the year of grace 1920,
there came into being a special and very select
club. There was no entrance fee and no subscription,
in which respect it differed from all
other clubs. Its membership was limited to six:
the <span class='it'>Actor</span>, the <span class='it'>Barrister</span>, the <span class='it'>Doctor</span>, the <span class='it'>Ordinary
Man</span>, the <span class='it'>Soldier</span>, and the <span class='it'>Writer</span>. And since each
in his own particular trade had achieved what
the world calls fame, except the Ordinary Man,
who was only ordinary, it was decided that for
purposes of convenience they should be entered
in the list of members alphabetically according
to their trade, and further that they should carry
out the only rule of the club in the order of that
entry. And the only rule of the club was, that
on certain nights, to be mutually agreed on, the
member whose turn it was should give to the
remaining members an exceedingly good dinner,
after which he should tell them a story connected
with his own trade, that should be of sufficient
interest to keep them awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the only penalty of the club was that if the
story was not of sufficient interest to keep the
audience awake, the offending member should pay
a sum of ten pounds to a deserving charity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No rule was deemed necessary as to the quality
of the dinner: the members had elected themselves
with discretion.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“The</span> trouble in my game,” he began, “is that
the greatest plays can never be staged. There
would be no money in them. The public
demand a plot—a climax: after that the puppets
cease strutting, the curtain rings down. But
in life—in real life—there’s no plot. It’s just
a series of anti-climaxes strung together like a
patchwork quilt, until there comes the greatest
anti-climax of all and the quilt is finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed his hand through his fast-greying
hair, and stared for a moment or two at the fire.
The Soldier was filling his pipe; the Writer, his
legs stretched in front of him, had his hands
thrust deep in his trouser pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s one of the patches in one of the quilts
that my story is about,” continued the actor
thoughtfully. “Just an episode in the life of a
woman—or shall I say, just the life of a woman
in an episode?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember that play of mine—‘John
Pendlesham’s Wife’?” He turned to the
Barrister, who nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” he answered. “Molly Travers
was your leading lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was out of England,” said the Soldier.
“Never saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s immaterial.” The Actor lit a cigarette.
“The play itself has nothing to do with my
story, except indirectly. But as you didn’t see
it, I will just explain this much. I, of course,
was John Pendlesham—Molly was my wife, and
the third act constituted what, in my opinion,
was the finest piece of emotional acting which
that consummate actress has ever done in her
career.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Writer nodded. “I agree. She was
superb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night after night the fall of the curtain found
her nearly fainting; night after night there was
that breathless moment of utter silence followed
by a perfect crash of applause. I am mentioning
these old facts because her marvellous performance
does concern my story directly—even
though the play does not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had been running about a month, I
suppose, when my story begins. I had just
come off after the third act, and was going to
my dressing-room. For some reason, instead
of going by the direct door which led into it
from the stage, I went outside into the passage.
There were some hands moving furniture or
something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ve all of you been behind at my
theatre. First you come to the swing doors
out of the street, inside which the watch dog
sits demanding callers’ business. Then there is
another door, and beyond that there are three
steps down to my room. And it was just as I
was opening my door on that night that I happened
to look round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Standing at the top of the three stairs was a
woman who was staring at me. I only saw her
for a moment: then the watch dog intervened,
and I went into my room. But I <span class='it'>had</span> seen her
for a moment: I had seen her for long enough to
get the look in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We get all sorts and conditions of people behind,
as you’d expect—stage-struck girls, actors
out of a shop, autograph hunters, beggars. And
the watch dog knew my invariable rule: only
personal friends and people who had made an appointment
by letter were allowed inside the second
door. But a rule cannot legislate for every case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gad! you fellows, it’s many years now since
that night, but I can still feel, as clearly as if it
were yesterday, the message in that girl’s eyes.
There had been hope and fear and pitiful
entreaty: the look of one who had staked everything
on a last desperate throw: the look of a
mother who is fighting for her child. It was
amazing: I couldn’t understand it. As I stood
just inside my door I couldn’t have told you
whether she was old or young, plain or pretty.
And yet in that one fleeting second this vivid,
jumbled message had reached me.” The Actor
pressed out his cigarette, and there was silence
while he lit another one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment I hesitated,” he continued
after a while; “then I rang the bell for the
watch dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who is that lady I saw outside there?’
I asked, as he came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Won’t give no name, sir,’ he answered.
‘Wants to see you, but I told her the rules.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once again I hesitated; probably I’d
exaggerated—put a totally false construction
on her expression, probably she was looking for
a job like the rest of them. And then I knew
that I’d got to see that woman, and that I should
have no peace of mind until I’d heard what she
had to say. The watch dog was regarding me
curiously; plainly he could see no reason whatever
for my hesitation. He was a matter-of-fact
fellow, was the guardian of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Show her in, I’ll see her now.’ I had my
back to him, but I could feel his virtuous indignation.
After all, rules are rules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now, sir?’ he echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now; at once.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went out, and I heard him go up the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Trayne will see you. Come this way.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the door opened again, and I
turned to face the woman. She was young—quite
young, dressed in a kind of cheap suburban
frock. Her shoes had been good ones—once,
now—well, however skilfully a patch is put on
it is still a patch. Her gloves showed traces of
much needle and cotton; the little bag she
carried was rubbed and frayed. And over the
cheap suburban frock she had on a coat which
was worn and threadbare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It was good of you to see me, Mr. Trayne.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was nervous and her voice shook a little,
but she faced me quite steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s a very unusual thing for me to do,’ I
said. ‘But I saw you at the top of the stairs,
and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know it’s unusual,’ she interrupted.
‘The man outside there told me your rule.
But believe me’—she was talking with more
assurance now—‘my reason for coming to see
you is very unusual also.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pulled up a chair for her. ‘What is your
reason?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She took a deep breath and began fumbling
with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know you will think me mad,’ she began,
‘but I don’t want to tell you my reason now. I
want to wait until after the play is over, and
I know you go on at once in the fourth act.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’ve seen the play, then?’ I remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ve seen the play,’ was her somewhat
astonishing answer, ‘every night since the
first.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Every night!’ I stared at her in surprise.
‘But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have glanced at her clothes or something
and she saw what was in my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I suppose you think that I hardly look as
if I could afford such luxuries,’ she smiled
faintly. ‘I’ve only seen it from the gallery and
pit, you know. And even that has meant that
I’ve had to go without lunch. But—you see—it
was necessary for me to see it: I had to. It
was part of my plan—a necessary part.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t want to seem dense,’ I said gently,
‘but I’m afraid I don’t quite follow. How can
seeing my play thirty odd times be a necessary
part of your plan?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s what I don’t want to tell you now,’
she repeated, and once more her hands began
twisting nervously. ‘I want to wait till afterwards,
when perhaps you’ll—of your kindness—do
as I ask you. Oh! Mr. Trayne—for God’s
sake, don’t fail me!’ She leant forward beseechingly
in her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My dear child,’ I answered quietly—I
don’t think she can have been much more than
twenty, ‘you haven’t told me yet what you want
me to do.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I want you to come to a house in Kensington
with me,’ she said steadily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again the Actor paused, and stared at the
fire. Then he gave a short laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When she said that, I looked at her pretty
sharply. Without appearing conceited or anything
of that sort, one has occasionally in the
course of one’s career, received certain flattering
attentions from charming women—attentions
which—er—one is tempted to conceal from one’s
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” murmured the Ordinary Man.
“Precisely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for a moment, I must confess that the
thought passed through my mind that this was
one of those occasions. And it wasn’t until the
colour rose to her face and stained it scarlet, that
I realised that not only had I made a mistake, but
that I had been foolish enough to let her see that
I had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My God!’ she whispered, ‘you don’t
think—you couldn’t think—that I meant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She rose and almost cowered away from me.
‘Why, I’m married.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I refrained from remarking that the fact was
hardly such a conclusive proof of the absurdity
of my unspoken thought as she seemed to
imagine. I merely bowed, and said a little
formally: ‘Please don’t jump to conclusions.
May I ask why you wish me to come to a house in
Kensington with you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The colour ebbed away from her cheeks, and
she sat down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s the very thing I don’t want to tell
you, until you come,’ she answered very low. ‘I
know it sounds absurd—it must do, it seems as
if I were being unnecessarily mysterious. But I
can’t tell you, Mr. Trayne, I can’t tell you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Not yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the call boy knocked, and I had
to go on for the last act. In a way I suppose
it was absurd of me—but life is made up of impulses.
I confess that the whole thing intrigued
me. When a woman comes and tells you that
she has seen your play every night since it
started; that she’s had to go without her lunch
to do so; that it was a necessary part of some
wonderful plan, and that she wants you to go
to a house in Kensington, the least curious man
would be attracted. And from my earliest infancy
I’ve always been engrossed in other people’s
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘All right,’ I said briefly. ‘I’ll come with
you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I had to put out my hand to
steady her, I thought she was going to faint.
Reaction, I thought at the time; later, it struck
me that the reason was much more prosaic—lack
of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stopped for a moment till she seemed herself
again; then I told her to wait outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I shall be about half an hour,’ I said, ‘and
then we’ll take a taxi, and go down to Kensington.
Tell them to give you a chair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my last impression as I went on to the
stage was of a white-faced girl clutching the table,
staring at me with great brown eyes that held in
them a dawning triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” went on the Actor thoughtfully,
“that that is where the tragedy of it all really
lay. Afterwards she told me that the part of
her plan which had seemed most difficult to her
was getting my consent to go with her to Kensington.
Once that was done, she knew all would be
well, she was absolutely and supremely confident.
And when I went on to the stage for the fourth
act, she felt that success had crowned her efforts,
that what was to come after was nothing compared
to that which she had already done. The
inaccessible stronghold had been stormed, the
ogre had proved to be a lamb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we went to Kensington. I sent my
own car home, and we took a taxi. During
the drive she was very silent, and I didn’t try
to make her talk. Evidently no inkling of the
mysterious plan was to be revealed until we arrived
at the address she had given the driver.
It was some obscure street that I had never
heard of and the name of which I have completely
forgotten. I know it was somewhere not
far from Barker’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The door was opened by a repulsive-looking
woman who peered at me suspiciously. And
then the girl took her on one side and whispered
something in her ear. Apparently it had the
desired effect, as the Gorgon retired grumbling
to an odoriferous basement, leaving us alone in
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When she had shut the door the girl turned
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you come upstairs, Mr. Trayne. I
want you to meet my husband.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bowed. ‘Certainly,’ I said, and she led
the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So the husband was in the plan,’ I reflected
as I followed her. Was he a genius with a play
that he proposed to read to me? I had suffered
from the plays of genius before. Or was he some
actor down on his luck? If so, why all the
mystery? And then, when I’d made up my
mind that it was a mere begging case, we arrived at
the room. Just before she turned the handle of
the door she again looked at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My husband is ill, Mr. Trayne. You’ll
excuse his being in bed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we went in. Good Lord! you fellows,”
the Actor leant forward in his chair. “I’ve been
pretty hard up in the old days, but as I stood
inside that door I realised for the first time what
poverty—real poverty—meant. Mark you, the
girl was a lady; the weak, cadaverous-looking
fellow propped up in bed with a tattered shawl
round his shoulders was a gentleman. And
beyond the bed, and one chair, and a rackety old
chest-of-drawers there wasn’t a stick of furniture
in the room. There was a curtain in the corner
with what looked like a washstand behind it, and
a shelf by the bed with two cups and some plates
on it. And nothing else except an appalling
oleograph of Queen Victoria on the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This is Mr. Trayne, dear.’ She was bending
over her husband, and after a moment he looked
up at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It was good of you to come, sir,’ he said.
‘Very good.’ And then he turned to his wife and
I heard him say: ‘Have you told him yet,
Kitty?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shook her head. ‘Not yet, darling, I
will now.’ She left his side and came over to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Trayne, I know you thought me very
peculiar at the theatre. But I was afraid that
if I told you what I really wanted you’d have
refused to come. You get hundreds and hundreds
of people coming to see you who think they can
act. Asking you to help them get a job and that
sort of thing. Well, I was afraid that if I told
you that that was what I wanted, you’d have
told me to go away. Perhaps you’d have given
me a straw of comfort—taken my address—said
you’d let me know if anything turned up. But
nothing would have turned up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And, you
see, I was rather desperate.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The big brown eyes were fixed on me
pleadingly, and somehow I didn’t feel quite as
annoyed as I should have done at what was
nothing more nor less than a blatant trick to
appeal to my sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perhaps nothing would have turned up,’
I said gently, ‘but you must remember that
to-day the stage is a hopelessly overstocked
profession. There are hundreds of trained actors
and actresses unable to obtain a job.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know that,’ she cried eagerly, ‘and that’s
why I—why I thought out this plan. I thought
that if I could <span class='it'>really</span> convince you that I could act
above the average .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And she can, Mr. Trayne,’ broke in her
husband. ‘She’s good, I know it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We must leave Mr. Trayne to be the judge
of that, Harry,’ she smiled. ‘You see,’ she went
on to me, ‘what I felt was that there is an
opening for real talent. There is, isn’t there?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ I agreed slowly. ‘There is an
opening for <span class='it'>real</span> talent. But even that is a small
one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have you ever acted before?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A little. In amateur theatricals!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I turned away. Amateur theatricals! More
heart-burning and disappointment has been
caused by those abominable entertainments than
their misguided originators will ever realise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But don’t think I’m relying on that.’ The
girl was speaking again, and I almost laughed.
‘I want you to judge me to-night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swung round and looked at her. So this
was the mysterious plan: I was to witness an
impromptu performance, which was to convince
me that the second Sarah Bernhardt had been
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I couldn’t have shown you, you see, in
your dressing-room. I shouldn’t have had time.
That’s why I asked you to come here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You have the courage of your convictions
anyway,’ I said quietly. ‘I am perfectly ready
to be convinced.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then will you sit there.’ She took off her
hat and coat as I sat down on the only available
chair, and from underneath his pillow the man
produced a paper-covered book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’ll forgive me if I read my lines, Mr.
Trayne,’ he said. ‘I find I can’t learn them—I
can’t concentrate.’ He passed a thin,
emaciated hand over his forehead. ‘And it’s
her you want to see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned over the pages weakly; then he
began to read. And I—I sat up as if I’d been
stung. At last everything was clear: the continual
visits to the theatre—everything. The
part of all others which they had selected to
prove her ability, was the love-scene between
Molly Travers and myself in the third act of
‘John Pendlesham’s Wife.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while there was silence, while the Actor
thoughtfully lit another cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This unknown child,” he went on after a
moment, “who had acted a little in amateur
theatricals, had deliberately challenged London’s
greatest emotional actress in her most marvellous
success before, Heaven help us, <span class='it'>me</span>—of all people.
I suppose if I was writing a story I should say
that she triumphed; that as I sat in that bare
and hideous room I realised that before me was
genius—a second and greater Molly; that from
that moment her foot was set on the ladder of
fame, and there was no looking back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Actor laughed a little sadly. “Unfortunately,
I’m not writing a story, I’m telling
the truth. I don’t know how I sat through the
next twenty minutes. It was the most ghastly
caricature of Molly that I have ever thought of;
the more ghastly because it was so intensely
unintentional. Every little gesture was faithfully
copied; every little trick and mannerism had
been carefully learnt by heart. And this, as I
say, to me who acted with that divine genius
every night. God! it was awful. That marvellous
line of Molly’s, when, standing in the
centre of the stage facing me across the table, she
said: ‘Then you don’t want me back?’ that
line which was made marvellous merely through
the consummate restraint with which she said it,
sounded from this poor child like a parlour-maid
giving notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, at last it was over, and I realised
I had to say something. They were both staring
at me, hope shining clear in the girl’s eyes and
pride in the man’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She’s great, isn’t she, Mr. Trayne?’ he
said. ‘I’ve not had the privilege of seeing you
and Miss Travers in the part—but I feel that
now—why,’ he gave a little shaky laugh, ‘that it’s
hardly necessary.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” said the Actor slowly, “that was
the devil of it all. They were both so utterly
certain, especially the man. The difficulty had
been to get me there; after that it had been easy.
I glanced at the poor fellow in the bed, and his
thoughts were plain to read. No more grinding
poverty, no more unfurnished bed-sitting rooms,
and—fame for the woman he loved! And then
he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m such a hopeless crock, Mr. Trayne, and
she’—he took one of her hands in both his
own—‘she’s had to do all the work. Beastly,
grinding work in an office, when she was capable
of this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl bent over him, and I looked away.
It seemed to me that the ground on which I stood
was holy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Actor gave a short laugh which deceived
no one. “I suppose I was an ass,” he went on,
“but I’d do it again to-day. ‘It was wonderful,’
I said, ‘quite wonderful.’ And because I’m an
actor they believed me. Not that he, at any
rate, required much convincing—he only wanted
his knowledge confirmed. Of course, when I
spoke I didn’t realise what I was letting myself
in for. I should have done, I suppose, but—I
wasn’t left long in doubt. If she was wonderful—and
had not I, Herbert Trayne, said so—what
about a job? At once .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With my backing
it was easy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Which was all quite true
except for the one vital fact of my having
lied. But, hang it, you fellows!” he exploded,
“could you have told ’em it was the most
appalling exhibition of utter futility you’d ever
witnessed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I couldn’t,” said the Soldier. “What
happened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see them now,” continued the Actor.
“He was holding her hand, and looking up into
her face—as a dog looks at the being it adores.
And she was smiling a little, and crying a little—tears
of pure joy. The strain was over, the
lunches had not been missed in vain. And I
stood there like a dumb idiot racking my brains
for something to say. They thought I was
wondering what job to offer her; they were
right, I was.” The Actor laughed shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’d gone into the morass, and there was
nothing for it but to blunder in deeper. The one
vital essential was that in no circumstances must
the poor child ever be allowed to act. The other
was money—and at once. So I offered her then
and there a job as Molly Travers’ understudy at
five pounds a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott!” The Doctor sat up with a
jerk. “Understudy Molly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I explained, of course,” went on the Actor,
“that there was an understudy already, and that
to save unpleasantness it would be better if she
didn’t come to the theatre, unless I sent for her.
That, of course, it was more than likely that Miss
Travers wouldn’t be ill during the run of the play,
and that in those circumstances I didn’t want
to offend the present understudy. And when
another play came along, we must see what we
could do. That, thank Heaven, I knew was some
way off yet! It gave me breathing space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave her a week’s salary in advance, and
I got away—somehow. I think they were both a
little dazed with the wonder of it, and they
wanted to be alone. I heard his voice—weak
and quavering—as I shut the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! my very dear girl,’ he was whispering—and
she was on her knees beside the bed. And
I blundered my way downstairs, cursing myself
for a sentimental fool. There’s whisky on the
table, you fellows. Help yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one moved, and the Actor lit another
cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw her occasionally during the next two
or three months,” he continued, “though I never
went to their rooms again. They had moved—I
knew that—because I used to post the cheque
every week. But the few times I did see her, I
gathered that her husband was not getting any
better. And one day I insisted on Lawrence,
the specialist, going to see him. I couldn’t have
one of my company being worried, I told her, over
things of that sort. I can see her face now as I
said ‘one of my company.’ I don’t know what
Lawrence said to her, but he rang me up at the
theatre that night, and he did not mince his words
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I give him a month,’ he said. ‘It’s galloping
consumption.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just about a month later that the
thing happened which I had been dreading.
Molly went down with ’flu. Her understudy—the
real one—was Violet Dorman, who was
unknown then. And, of course it was her
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment,” interrupted the Barrister.
“Did anyone at the theatre know about this
girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God! no,” cried the Actor. “Not
a soul. In this censorious world actions such as
mine in that case are apt to be misconstrued,
which alone was sufficient to make me keep it
dark. No one knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first night—all was well. Molly went
down in the afternoon, and it didn’t come out in
any of the evening papers. Violet acted magnificently.
She wasn’t Molly, of course—she isn’t
now. But it was her chance, and she took it—and
took it well. Next morning the papers,
naturally, had it in. ‘Temporary indisposition
of Miss Molly Travers. Part filled at a moment’s
notice with great credit by Miss Violet Dorman.’
She had a press agent and he boomed her for all
he was worth. And I read the papers and cursed.
Not that I grudged her her success in the slightest,
but I was thinking of the afternoon. It was
matinée day and the girl must read it in the
papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was only one thing for it—to go round
and see her. Whatever happened I had to prevent
her coming to the theatre. How I was going
to do it without giving the show away I hadn’t an
idea, but somehow or other it had got to be done.
My blundering foolishness—even though it had
been for the best—had caused the trouble; it
was up to me to try and right it. So I went round
and found her with a doctor in the sitting-room.
He was just going as I came in, and his face was
grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Harry’s dying,’ she said to me quite simply,
and I glanced at the doctor, who nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child! I crossed over to her side, and
though it seems an awful thing to say, my only
feeling was one of relief. After what Lawrence
had said I knew it was hopeless, and since the
poor devil had to go he couldn’t have chosen a
more opportune moment from my point of view.
It solved the difficulty. If he was dying she
couldn’t come to the theatre, and by the time
the funeral was over Molly would be back. I
didn’t realise that one doesn’t get out of things
quite as easily as that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ve only just realised how bad he was,’
she went on in a flat, dead voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Does he know?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No. He thinks he’s going to get better.
Why didn’t you send for me last night, Mr.
Trayne?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so unexpected, that I hesitated and
stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I couldn’t get at you in time,’ I said finally.
‘Miss Travers only became ill late in the afternoon.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a strange look on her face she opened a
paper—some cursed rag I hadn’t seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It says here,’ she went on slowly, ‘that
she was confined to her bed all yesterday. Oh!
it doesn’t matter much, does it?’ She put
the paper down wearily, and gave the most
heartrending little sobbing laugh I’ve ever
heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you mean?’ I stammered out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I suppose you did it for the best, Mr.
Trayne. I suppose I ought to be grateful. But
you lied that night—didn’t you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was fingering a book on the table and for the
life of me I couldn’t think of anything to say.
‘He doesn’t know,’ she went on. ‘He still
thinks I’m a God-sent genius. And he mustn’t
know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why should he?’ I said. And then I
put my hand on her arm. ‘Tell me, how did you
find out?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You admit it then?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ I said quietly, ‘I admit that I lied.
I was so desperately sorry for you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I mentioned it to someone—a man who
knew the stage—about a week ago. He looked
at me in blank amazement, and then he laughed.
I suppose he couldn’t help it: it was so ridiculous.
I was furious—furious. But afterwards I began
to think, and I asked other people one or two
questions—and then that came,’ she pointed to
the paper, ‘and I knew. And now—oh! thank
God—he’s dying. He mustn’t know, Mr. Trayne,
he mustn’t.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at that moment he came into the room—tottered
in is a better word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Boy,’ she cried in an agony, ‘what are you
doing?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I thought I heard Mr. Trayne’s voice,’ he
whispered, collapsing in the chair. ‘I’m much
better to-day, much. Bit weak still——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he saw the paper, and he leant
forward eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ill,’ he cried. ‘Molly Travers ill. Why, my
dear—but it’s your chance.’ He read on a bit,
and she looked at me desperately. ‘But why
weren’t you there last night? Who is this
woman, Violet Dorman?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You see, Tracy,’ I said, picking up the paper
and putting it out of his reach, ‘it was so sudden,
Miss Travers’ illness, that I couldn’t get at your
wife in time.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Quite,’ he whispered. ‘Of course. But
there’s a matinée this afternoon, isn’t there?
Oh! I wonder if I’m well enough to go. I’m
so much better to-day.’ And then he looked at
his wife. ‘My dear! my dear—at last!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen such pathetic
pride and love shining in a man’s face before or
since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m afraid you won’t be quite well enough
to go,’ I muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perhaps it would be wiser not to,’ he
whispered. ‘But to think I shall miss her first
appearance. Have you come to fetch her now,
Mr. Trayne?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, darling,’ the girl replied, and her voice
sounded as steady as a rock. ‘Mr. Trayne has
come to fetch me. But it’s early yet and I want
you to go back to bed now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without a glance at me she helped him from
the room and left me standing there. I heard
their voices—hers clear and strong, his barely
audible. And not for the first time in my life I
marvelled at the wonder of a woman who loves.
I was to marvel more in a moment or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came back and shut the door. Then she
stood facing me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There’s only one way, Mr. Trayne, though I
think it’s going to break my heart. I must go
to the theatre.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But—your husband .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ I stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! I’m not really going. I shall be
here—at hand—the whole time. Because if the
end did come—why then—I <span class='it'>must</span> be with him.
But he’s got to think I’ve gone; I’ve got to hide
from him until after the matinée is over. And
then I must tell him’—she faltered a little—‘of
my success. I’ll keep the papers from him—if
it’s necessary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ She turned away and I
heard her falter: ‘Three hours away from him—when
he’s dying. Oh, my God!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Actor paused, and the Soldier stirred
restlessly in his chair. “I left shortly after,”
he went on at length, “I saw she wanted me to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All through the play that afternoon it
haunted me—the pathos of it—aye, the horror of
it. I pictured that girl hiding somewhere, while
in the room above the sands were running out.
Longing with all the power of her being to go to
him—to snatch every fleeting minute with him—and
yet condemned by my stupidity to forfeit
her right. And then at last the show was over,
and I went to her room again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was by his side, kneeling on the floor,
as I came in. As he saw me he struggled up on
his elbow, and one could see it was the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dear fellow,’ I said, ‘she was wonderful—just
wonderful!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the girl looked up at me through her
blinding tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just wonderful,’ I said again. Five minutes
later he died.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Actor fell silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see her again?” asked the
Soldier thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never: she disappeared. Just a patch on
the quilt as I said. But there was one thread
missing. Three years later I received a registered
envelope. There was no letter inside, no word
of any sort. Just these.” He fumbled in his
pocket. “There are twenty of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his hand, and the Soldier leaning
forward saw that it contained a little bundle of
five-pound notes.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“This</span> morning,” he began, leaning back in his
chair and crossing his legs, “I mislaid my cigarette-case.
I knew it was somewhere in the study,
but find it I could not. Finally, having searched
all over my writing table, I rang the bell, and
somewhat irritably demanded its immediate
production. The butler stepped forward and
lifted it up from the centre of the blotting pad,
where it had been the whole time, literally under
my nose. What peculiar temporary kink in the
brain had prevented my noticing the very thing I
was looking for, when it was lying in the most
conspicuous place in which it could possibly have
been, I don’t know. I leave that to the Doctor.
But the point of my parable is this—it decided
in my mind the story with which I should bore
you fellows to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused to light a cigar, then he glanced
round at the faces of the other five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if, as I get on with it, you think you
recognise the real characters under the fictional
names I shall give them, I can’t prevent you.
But don’t ask me to confirm your thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” murmured the Actor. “Fire
ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was about four years before the war,”
commenced the Barrister, “that I was stopping
for a few nights at a certain house in Park Lane.
It was in the middle of the season—June, to be
accurate—and I was waiting to get in here. My
wife was in the country, and, as I was more or
less at a loose end, I accepted the offer of staying
at this house. My hostess—shall we call her
Granger, Ruth Granger—had been an old school
pal of my wife’s; in later years she had become
a real, intimate friend of us both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the time of which I speak she was a
lovely girl of twenty-six, with the suffering of
six years of hell in her eyes. At the age of
twenty she had married Sir Henry Granger, and
that fatal mistake had been the cause of the
hell. Henry Granger was one of the most
loathsome brutes it has ever been my misfortune
to run across. He had not one single instinct
of a gentleman in him, though he did happen to
be the tenth baronet. How her parents had
ever allowed the marriage beat me completely.
Perhaps it was money, for Granger was rich;
but whatever it was she married him, and her
hell began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Granger was simply an animal, a coarse and
vicious animal. He drank heavily without
getting drunk, which is always a dangerous sign,
and he possessed the morals—or did not possess
the morals, whichever you prefer—of a monkey.
He was unfaithful to her on their honeymoon—my
wife told me that; and from then on he made
not the slightest attempt to conceal his mode of
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister carefully removed the ash from
his cigar. “I won’t labour the point,” he went
on with a faint smile. “We have all of us met
the type, but I’d like to emphasise the fact that I,
at any rate, have never met any member of that
type who came within a mile of him. Most of
’em have some semblance of decency about ’em—make
some attempt to conceal their affairs.
Granger didn’t; he seemed to prefer that they
should be known. Sometimes since then I have
wondered whether he was actuated by a sort of
blind rage—by a mad desire to pierce through
the calm, icy contempt of his wife; to make her
writhe and suffer, because he realised she was so
immeasurably his superior.” He paused thoughtfully.
“He made her suffer right enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she never try for a divorce?” asked
the Soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, never. We discussed it once—she, and
my wife and I; and I had to explain to her our
peculiar laws on the subject. His adultery by
itself was, of course, not sufficient, and for some
reason she flatly refused to consider a mere
separation. She wouldn’t face the scandal and
publicity for only that. I said to her then:
‘Why not apply for a restitution of conjugal
rights. Get your husband to leave the house, and
if he doesn’t return in fourteen days——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She stopped me with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It seems rather fatuous,’ she said slowly,
‘getting a lawyer to ask my husband to do what
he is only too ready to do—return to me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But surely,’ I began, not quite taking her
meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You see, Bill,’ she answered in a flat, dead
voice, ‘my husband is very fond of me—as a
stopgap. After most of his episodes he honours
me with his attentions for two or three days.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was the devil of it—he didn’t intend to
let her divorce him. She formed an excellent
hostess for his house, and for the rest there were
always <span class='it'>les autres</span>. And he wanted her, too,
because he couldn’t get her, and that made him
mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister leant forward, and the firelight
flickered on his thin, ascetic face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such was the state of affairs when I went
to stay. The particular lady at the time who was
being honoured by Henry Granger was a shining
light in musical comedy—Nelly Jones, shall we
call her? It is very far from her real name. If
possible, he had been more open over this affair
than usual; everyone who knew the Grangers in
London knew about it—<span class='it'>everyone</span>. He had twice
dined with her at the same restaurant at which his
wife was entertaining, once deliberately selecting
the next table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an unmitigated swine!” cried the
Ordinary Man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was,” agreed the Barrister briefly.
“But even that was not sufficient to satisfy the
gentleman. He proceeded to do a thing which
put him for ever outside the pale. He brought
this girl to a reception of his wife’s at his own
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the night that I arrived. She had
fixed up one of those ghastly entertainments
which are now, thank Heaven, practically extinct.
Somebody sings and nobody listens, and you meet
everybody you particularly want to avoid.
Mercifully I ran into an old pal, also of your
calling, Actor-man—Violet Seymour. No reason
why I should disguise her name at any rate.
She was not acting at the moment, and we sat
in a sort of alcove-place at the top of the stairs,
on the same landing as the reception-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There’s going to be a break here soon,
Bill,’ she said to me after a while. ‘Ruth is
going to snap.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Poor girl!’ I answered. ‘But what the
devil can one do, Violet?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nothing,’ she said fiercely, ‘except alter
your abominably unjust laws. Why can’t she
get a divorce, Bill? It’s vile—utterly vile.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then—well, let’s call him Sir Edward
Shoreham, joined us. He was on the Bench—a
judge, which makes the disguise of a false name
pretty thin, especially in view of what is to come.
I remember he had recently taken a murder case—one
that had aroused a good deal of popular
attention—and the prisoner had been found
guilty. We were talking about it at the time Sir
Edward arrived, with Violet, as usual, tilting
lances against every form of authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see her now as she turned to Sir Edward
with a sort of dreadful fascination on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And so you sentenced him to death?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He nodded gravely. ‘Certainly,’ he answered.
‘He was guilty.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then she turned half-away, speaking
almost under her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And doesn’t it ever appall you? Make you
wake in the middle of the night, with your mouth
dry and your throat parched. All this—life,
love—and in a cell, a man waiting—a man you’ve
sent there. Ticking off the days on his nerveless
fingers—staring out at the sun. My God! it
would drive me mad.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ned Shoreham smiled a little grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You seem to forget one unimportant factor,’
he answered; ‘the wretched woman that man
killed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, I don’t,’ she cried. ‘But the punishment
is so immeasurably worse than the crime.
I don’t think death would matter if it came suddenly;
but to sit waiting with a sort of sickening
helplessness——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then Ruth Granger joined us. Some
woman was singing in the reception-room and,
for the moment, she was free from her duties as
hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You seem very serious,’ she said with her
grave, sweet smile, holding out her hand to Sir
Edward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Miss Seymour is a revolutionary,’ he
answered lightly, and I happened at that
moment to glance at Ruth. And for the moment
she had let the mask slip as she looked at Ned
Shoreham’s face. Then it was replaced, but
their secret was out, as far as I was concerned,
though on matters of affection I am the least
observant of mortals. If they weren’t in love
with one another, they were as near to it as made
no odds. And it gave me a bit of a shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoreham was young—young, at any rate,
for the Bench—and he was unmarried. And
somehow I couldn’t fit Shoreham into the
situation of loving another man’s wife. There
had never been a breath of scandal that I had
heard; if there had been, it would have finished
him for good. A judge must be like Cæsar’s
wife. And Shoreham, even then, had established
a reputation for the most scrupulous observance
of the law. His enemies called him cruel and
harsh; those who knew him better realised that
his apparent harshness was merely a cloak he had
wrapped tightly round himself as a guard against
a naturally tender heart. I don’t know any man
that I can think of who had such an undeviating
idea of duty as Shoreham, and without being
in the least a prig, such an exalted idea of the
responsibilities of his position. And to realise
suddenly that he was in love with Ruth Granger,
as I say, came as a shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What was the argument about?’ she said,
sitting down beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Morality <span class='it'>versus</span> the Law,’ chipped in Violet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The individual <span class='it'>versus</span> the community,’
amended Sir Edward. ‘Justice—real justice—against
sickly sentimentality, with all due deference
to you, Miss Seymour. There are hard
cases, one knows, but hard cases make bad laws.
There’s been far too much lately of men taking
matters into their own hands—this so-called
Unwritten Law. And it has got to stop.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You would never admit the justification,’
said Ruth slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Never—in any circumstances,’ he answered.
‘You have the law—then appeal to the law.
Otherwise there occurs chaos.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And what of the cases where the law gives
no redress?’ demanded Violet, and even as she
spoke Granger came up the stairs with this girl on
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth Granger rose, deathly white, and gazed
speechlessly at her husband’s coarse, sneering
face. I don’t think for a moment she fully
grasped the immensity of the insult; she was
stunned. The footmen were staring open-mouthed;
guests passing into the supper-room
stopped and smirked. And then it was over;
the tension snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Have you had any supper, Sir Edward?’
said Ruth calmly, and with her hand on his arm
she swept past her husband, completely ignoring
both him and the girl, who flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I suppose,’ said Violet Seymour to me, as
Granger and the girl went into the reception-room,
‘that had Ruth shot that filthy blackguard
dead on the stairs, Sir Edward would have
piously folded his hands and, in due course,
sentenced her to death.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at the moment I certainly sympathised
with her point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister got up and splashed some soda-water
into a glass. Then he continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t weary you with an account of the
rest of the reception. You can imagine for yourselves
the covert sneers and whisperings. I want
to go on two or three hours to the time when the
guests had gone, and a white-faced, tight-lipped
woman was staring at the dying embers of a fire
in her sitting-room, while I stood by the mantelpiece
wondering what the devil to do to help.
Granger was in his study, where he had retired on
the departure of Miss Jones, and I, personally,
had seen two bottles of champagne taken to him
there by one of the footmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s the end, Bill,’ she said, looking at me
suddenly, ‘absolutely the end. I can’t go on—not
after to-night. How dared he bring that
woman here? How dared he?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Violet had been right—the break had come.
Ruth Granger was desperate, and there was an
expression on her face that it wasn’t good to see.
It put the wind up me all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Go to bed, Ruth,’ I said quietly. ‘There’s
no good having a row with Granger to-night; you
can say what you want to say to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at that moment the door opened and
her husband came in. As I said, he was a man
who never got drunk, but that night he was
unsteady on his legs. He stood by the door,
swaying a little and staring at her with a sneer on
his face. He was a swine sober; in drink he was—well,
words fail. But, by God! you fellows, she
got through him and into him until I thought he
was going to strike her. I believe that was
what she was playing for at the time, because I
was there as a witness. But he didn’t, and when
she finished flaying him he merely laughed in her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And what about your own damned lover,
my virtuous darling?’ he sneered. ‘What
about the upright judge whom you adore—dear,
kind Edward Shoreham?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was unexpected; she didn’t know he
had guessed—and her face gave her away
for a moment. Then she straightened up
proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sir Edward Shoreham and I are on terms
which an animal of your gross mind couldn’t
possibly understand,’ she answered coldly, and
he laughed. ‘If you insinuate that he is my
lover in the accepted sense of the word, you lie
and you know it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without another word she walked contemptuously
by him, and the door closed behind her.
And after a moment or two I followed her, leaving
him staring moodily at the empty grate. I
couldn’t have spoken to him without being rude
and, after all, I was under his roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister leant back in his chair and
crossed his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that was the situation,” he continued,
“when I went to bed. My room was almost
opposite Lady Granger’s, and at the end of the
passage, which was a cul-de-sac, was the door
leading into Granger’s study. I hadn’t started
to undress when I heard him come past my room
and go along the passage to his study. And I was
still thinking over the situation about ten minutes
later when Lady Granger’s door opened. I knew
it was hers because I heard her speak to her maid,
telling her to go to bed. The girl said ‘Good
night,’ and something—I don’t quite know what—made
me look through the keyhole of my door.
I was feeling uneasy and alarmed; I suppose the
scene downstairs had unsettled me. And sure
enough, as soon as the maid’s footsteps had died
away, I saw through my spy-hole Ruth Granger
go down the passage towards her husband’s study.
For a moment I hesitated; an outsider’s position
is always awkward between husband and wife.
But one thing was very certain, those two were
in no condition to have another—and this time a
private—interview. I opened my door noiselessly
and peered out. It struck me that if I
heard things getting too heated I should have to
intervene. She was just opening the door of
his study as I looked along the passage, and then
in a flash the whole thing seemed to happen. The
door shut behind her; there was a pause of one—perhaps
two seconds—and a revolver shot rang
out, followed by the sound of a heavy fall. For
a moment I was stunned; then I raced along the
passage as hard as I could, and flung open the
door of the study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the floor lay Henry Granger, doubled up
and sprawling, while in the middle of the room
stood his wife staring at him speechlessly. At
her feet on the carpet was a revolver, an automatic
Colt. I stood there by the door staring
foolishly, and after a while she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There’s been an accident,’ she whispered.
‘Is he dead?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went up to the body and turned it over.
Through the shirt front was a small hole; underneath
the left shoulder blade was another.
Henry Granger had been shot through the heart
from point-blank range; death must have been
absolutely instantaneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My God, Ruth!’ I muttered. ‘How did
it happen?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Happen?’ she answered vaguely. ‘There
was a man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the window.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then she fainted. The butler, with a
couple of footmen, by this time had appeared at
the door, and I pulled myself together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Her ladyship’s maid at once,’ I said.
‘Sir Henry has been shot. Ring up a doctor,
and ask him to come round immediately.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The butler rushed off, but I kept the two
footmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Wait a moment,’ I cried, picking up the
revolver. ‘A man did it. Pull back the two
curtains by the window, and I’ll cover him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did as I told them, pulled back the two
heavy black curtains that were in front of the
window. It was set back in a sort of alcove, and
I had the revolver ready pointed to cover the
murderer. I covered empty air; there was no
one there. Then I walked over to the window
and looked out. It was wide open, and there was
a sheer drop of forty feet to the deserted area
below. I looked upwards—I looked sideways:
plain brickwork without footing for a cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Go down to the room below,’ I cried;
‘he may have got in there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They rushed away to come back and tell me
that not only were the windows bolted, but that
they were shuttered as well. And I thought they
looked at me curiously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused to relight his cigar; then he
continued thoughtfully:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know when I first began to feel
suspicious about this mysterious man. The
thing had been so sudden that for a while my
brain refused to work; then gradually my legal
training reasserted itself, and I started to piece
things together. Ruth had come-to again, and
I put one or two questions to her. She was still
very dazed, but she answered them quite
coherently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man in evening clothes—at least, she
thought he had on evening clothes—had been
in the room as she came in. She heard a shot;
the light went out and the window was thrown
up. And then she had turned on the light just
before I came in to see her husband lying dead on
the floor. She knew no more. I suppose I
must have looked a bit thoughtful, for she suddenly
got up from her chair and came up to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You believe me, Bill, don’t you?’ she said,
staring at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Of course, of course,’ I answered hurriedly.
‘Go and lie down now, Ruth, because we shall
have to send for the police.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without another word she left the room
with her maid, and, after telling the footmen to
wait downstairs till they were wanted, I sat down
to think. Now, this isn’t a detective story; such
as it is, it concerns a more interesting study than
the mere detection of crime. It concerns the
struggle in the soul of an upright man between
love and duty. And the man was Sir Edward
Shoreham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unknown to me she sent for him—asked
him to come at once—and he came. He was
shown by the butler into the study, where I was
still sitting at the desk, and he stopped motionless
by the door staring at the body, which had
not been moved. I was waiting for the doctor,
and I got up surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The butler told me he had been shot,’ he
said a little jerkily. ‘How did it happen?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I wasn’t expecting you, Sir Edward,’ I
answered slowly. ‘But I’m glad that you’ve
come. I’d like another opinion.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you mean?’ he cried. ‘Is there
any mystery?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll tell you exactly what happened as far
as I know the facts,’ I said. ‘Lady Granger
and her husband had a very bad quarrel to-night.
Then she came to bed, and so did I. Shortly
afterwards her husband came along into this room.
Now, my bedroom is in the passage you have
just come along, and about ten minutes after
Sir Henry came in here, his wife followed him.
I opened my door, because I was afraid they
might start quarrelling again, and he had been
drinking. I saw her come in; there was a pause,
and then a revolver shot rang out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Was this door shut?’ he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ I answered, ‘it was. I rushed along
the passage and came in. I found her standing,
with the revolver at her feet, staring at her
husband, who was lying where he is now. She
said: ‘There’s been an accident.’ And then
she muttered something about a man and
the window before she fainted. I went to the
window, and there was no one there. I looked
out; will you do the same?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I waited while he walked over and looked
out, and after what seemed an interminable time
he came back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How long was it after the shot before you
looked out?’ His voice was very low as he asked
the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not a quarter of a minute,’ I answered, and
we both stood staring at one another in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good God!’ he said at length, ‘what are
you driving at?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m not driving at anything, Sir Edward,’
I answered. ‘At least, I’m trying not to drive
at it. But the man is dead, and the police must
be sent for. What are we going to say?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The truth, of course,’ he answered instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Quite,’ I said slowly. ‘But what is the
truth?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned very white, and leant against one
of the old suits of armour, of which the dead man
had a wonderful collection all over the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did Lady Granger see this man go out of
the window?’ he asked at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, she only heard him open it. You see,
she says he switched off the light. It was on
when I rushed in.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A rope,’ he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Impossible in the time,’ I said; ‘utterly
impossible. Such a suggestion would be laughed
out of court.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came over and sat down heavily in a chair,
and his face was haggard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sir Edward,’ I went on desperately, ‘the
doctor will be here shortly; the police must be
sent for. We’ve got to decide something. This
man didn’t go out by the door or I’d have seen
him; only a fly could have gone out by the
window. We’ve got to face the facts.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You don’t believe there was a man here at
all,’ he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Heaven help me! I don’t,’ I answered.
‘It’s all so easy to reconstruct. The poor girl
was driven absolutely desperate by what happened
to-night, and by the last thing he said to
her after their quarrel.’ I looked at him for a
moment before going on. ‘He accused her of
being in love with you.’ I said it deliberately,
and he caught his breath sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can’t you see it all?’ I continued. ‘She
came in here, and she shot him; and when she’d
done it her nerves gave, and she said the first
thing to me that came into her head.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If you’re right,’ he said heavily, ‘it means
that Ruth will be tried for murder!’ He got up
with his hands to his temples. ‘My God!
Stratton,’ he cried, ‘this is awful. Premeditated
murder, too—not done blindly in the middle of a
quarrel, but a quarter of an hour after it was over.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s how it would strike a jury,’ I
answered gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Supposing she had done it suddenly,
blindly’—he was talking half to himself—‘snatched
the revolver off the table as he tried to
make love to her, let’s say.’ And then he stopped
and stared at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Supposing that had happened, it would be
better for her to say so at once,’ I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But it didn’t happen,’ he answered; ‘it
couldn’t have.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ I agreed. ‘It didn’t happen; it
couldn’t have. But supposing it had, Sir Edward,
what then?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Stop, Stratton,’ he cried. ‘For Heaven’s
sake, stop!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There’s no good stopping,’ I said. ‘We
haven’t any time for argument. Your legal
knowledge has suggested the same solution as
occurred to me. If <span class='it'>now</span>, at once, when we send
for the police, she says it was an accident—gives
a complete story, chapter and verse——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Invents it, you mean,’ he interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Call it what you like,’ I said, ‘but, unless
she does that and substantiates the story, she will
be tried for the premeditated and wilful murder
of her husband. She’ll have to be tried anyway,
but if she makes a voluntary confession—makes
a story out of it that will appeal to sentiment—they
will acquit her. It’s the only chance.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But it’s monstrous, man,’ he muttered—only
now his eyes were fixed on me questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look here, Sir Edward,’ I said, ‘let’s
discuss this matter calmly. Humanly speaking,
we know what happened. Ruth came along that
passage, opened this door, and shot her husband
dead through the heart—that is the case as I
should put it to the jury, the plain issue shorn of
all its trappings. What is going to be the
verdict?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoreham plucked at his collar as if he were
fighting for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If, on the other hand, the shot was not
immediate—and I am the only witness as to that;
if I had heard his voice raised in anger; if he
had sprung at her, tried to kiss her, and she
blindly, without thought, had snatched up the
first thing that came to her hand, the revolver,
not even knowing it was loaded—what then?
The servants can be squared. She was talking
wildly when she mentioned this man—didn’t
know what she was saying. And then, when she
got back to her room she realised that the truth
was best, and rang you up, a Judge. What
better possible proof could any jury have of her
desire to conceal nothing? And you with your
reputation on the Bench——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah, don’t, don’t!’ he cried hoarsely.
‘You’re driving me mad! You’re—you’re——!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Ned, what’s the matter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We both swung round. Ruth had come
in, unnoticed by us, and was staring at Shoreham
with wonder in her eyes. Then, with a
shudder, she stepped past her husband’s body and
came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They’ve just told me you were here,’ she
said, and then she gave a little cry. ‘Ned, why
are you looking like that? Ned! you don’t
think—you don’t think I did it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cowered back, looking first at him and
then at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You <span class='it'>can’t</span> think I did it,’ she whispered.
‘I tell you there was a man here—the man who
shot him. Oh! they’ll believe me, won’t they?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ruth,’ I said, ‘I want you to realise that
we’re both of us your friends.’ Which is the sort
of fatuous remark one does make when the
tension is a bit acute. She never even glanced
at me as I spoke; with a sort of sick horror in her
eyes, she was staring at Shoreham, and I
blundered on: ‘When you talked about this man
you were unnerved—distraught; you didn’t
know what you were saying. We both realise
that. But now we’ve got to think of the best
way of—of helping you. You see, the police
must be sent for—we ought to have sent for them
sooner—and——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She walked past me and went over to
Shoreham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do you believe I did it, Ned?’ she said
quietly. ‘If I swear to you that I didn’t—would
that convince you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But, Ruth,’ he cried desperately, ‘it isn’t
me you’ve got to convince—it’s the police. A
man couldn’t have got out of that window in the
time. It’s a physical impossibility. If you
told it to the police, they’d laugh. Tell us the
truth, my dear. I beseech you. Tell us the
truth, and we’ll see what can be done.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She stood very still, with her hands clenched
by her sides. And then quite deliberately she
spoke to Shoreham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If you don’t believe there was a man here,’
she said, ‘you <span class='it'>must</span> think I shot my husband.
There was no one else who could have done it.
Well—supposing I did. You acknowledge no
justification for such an act?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I started to speak, but she silenced me with
an imperative wave of her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Please, Bill——Well, Ned—I’m waiting.
If I did shoot him—what then?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister paused to relight his cigar, and
the others waited in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was staring at Shoreham,” he went on
after a while, “with a faint, half-mocking, wholly
tender smile on her lips, and if either he or I
had been less dense that smile should have made
us think. But at the moment I was absorbed
in the problem of how to save her; while she was
absorbed in a very different one concerning the
mentality of the man she cared for. And Shoreham—well,
he was absorbed in the old, old fight
between love and duty, and the fierceness of the
struggle was showing on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There in front of him stood the woman he
loved, the woman who had just shot her husband,
and the woman who was now free for him to
marry. He knew as well as I did that in adopting
the line I had suggested lay the best chance of
getting her acquitted. He knew as well as I did
that the vast majority of juries would acquit if
the story were put to them as we had outlined it.
He could visualise as well as I the scene in court.
Counsel for the defence—I’d already fixed on
Grayson in my mind as her counsel—outlining the
whole scene: her late husband’s abominable
conduct culminating in this final outrage at her
reception. And then as he came to the moment
of the tragedy, I could picture him turning to the
jury with passionate sincerity in his face—appealing
to them as men—happily married,
perhaps, but men, at any rate, to whom home
life was sacred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could hear his voice—low and earnest—as
he sketched for them that last scene. This poor,
slighted, tormented woman—girl, gentlemen, for
she is little more than a girl—went in desperation
to the man—well, he is dead now, and we will
leave it at that—to the man who had made her
life a veritable hell. She pleaded with him,
gentlemen, to allow her to divorce him—pleaded
for some remnant of decent feelings in him. And
what was his answer—what was the answer of
this devil who was her husband? Did he
meet her half-way? Did he profess the slightest
sorrow for his despicable conduct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, gentlemen—not one word. His sole
response was to spring at her in his drunken
frenzy and endeavour to fix his vile attentions on
her. And she, mad with terror and fright,
snatched up the revolver which was lying on the
desk. It might have been a ruler—anything;
she was not responsible at the moment for what
she did. Do you blame her, gentlemen? You
have daughters of your own. She no more knew
what she had in her hand than a baby would.
To keep him away—that was her sole idea. And
then—suddenly—it happened. The revolver
went off—the man fell dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did this girl do, gentlemen, after that?
Realising that he was dead, did she make any
attempt to conceal what she had done—to
conceal her share in the matter? No—exactly
the reverse. Instantly she rang up Sir Edward
Shoreham, whose views on such matters are well
known to you all. And then and there she told
him everything—concealing nothing, excusing
nothing. Sir Edward Shoreham of all people,
who, with due deference to such a distinguished
public man, has at times been regarded as—well—er—not
lenient in his judgments. And
you have heard what Sir Edward said in the
box.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again the Barrister paused and smiled
faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d got as far as that, you see, before
Shoreham answered her. And he had got as far
as that, too, I think. He saw it all, built on a
foundation of lies—built on the foundation of his
dishonour. No one would ever know except us
three—but that doesn’t make a thing easier for
the Edward Shorehams of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he spoke—in a low, tense voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If you shot him, dear,’ he said, ‘nothing
matters save getting you off.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people,” pursued the Barrister, “might
call it a victory—some people would call it a defeat.
Depends on one’s outlook; depends on
how much one really believes in the ‘Could not
love you half so much, loved I not honour more’
idea. But certainly the murderer himself was
very pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The murderer?” cried the Ordinary Man
sitting up suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The murderer,” returned the Barrister.
“That’s why I mentioned about my cigarette-case
this morning. He had been standing behind
the suit of armour in the corner the whole time.
He came out suddenly, and we all stared at him
speechlessly, and then he started coughing—a
dreadful tearing cough—which stained his handkerchief
scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must apologise,’ he said when he could
speak, ‘but there was another thing besides
shooting Granger that I wanted to do before I
died. That was why I didn’t want to be caught
to-night. However, a man must cough when he’s
got my complaint. But I’m glad I restrained
myself long enough to hear your decision, Sir
Edward. I congratulate you on it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You scoundrel!’ began Shoreham, starting
forward, ‘why didn’t you declare yourself
sooner?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because there’s another thing I wanted
to do,’ he repeated wearily. ‘In Paris, in the
Rue St. Claire, there lives a woman. She was
beautiful once—to me she is beautiful now. She
was <span class='it'>my</span> woman until——’ And his eyes sought
the dead body of Henry Granger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth took a deep breath. ‘Yes—until?’
she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Until he came,’ said the man gravely.
‘And God will decide between him and me. But
I would have liked to look on her once more, and
hold her hand, and tell her, yet again, that I
understood—absolutely.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then Ruth Granger crossed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What is her name and the number of the
house?’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sybil Deering is her name,’ he answered
slowly, ‘and the number is fourteen.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you leave it to me?’ she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment he stared at her in silence, then
he bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘From the bottom of my heart I thank you,
Lady Granger, and I hope you will have all the
happiness you deserve.’ He glanced at Shoreham
and smiled. ‘When a man loves everything
else goes to the wall, doesn’t it? Remember
that in the future, Sir Edward, when they’re
standing before you, wondering, trying to read
their fate. Someone loves them, just as you
love her.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister rose and drained his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is the conclusion of your suffering,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the man hanged?” asked the Soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he died a week later of galloping
consumption.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what of the other two?” demanded
the Actor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They married, and are living happily together
to-day, doing fruit farming as a hobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fruit farming!” echoed the Doctor. “Why
fruit farming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something to do,” said the Barrister. “You
see, Sir Edward has never tried another case.
Some men are made that way.”</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Sooner</span> or later,” began the Doctor, settling
himself comfortably in his chair, “it comes to
most of us. Sooner or later a man or a woman
comes to consult us on what they imagine to be
some trifling malady, and when we make our
examination we find that it isn’t trifling. And
occasionally we find that not only is the matter
not trifling, but that—well, you all have seen
Collier’s picture, ‘The Sentence of Death.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a thing, incidentally, which requires
careful thought—just how much you will tell.
Different people take things different ways, and
where it might be your duty to tell one man the
half-truth, to another it might be just as much
your duty to lie. But broadly speaking, I,
personally, have always maintained that, unless
the circumstances are quite exceptional, it is a
doctor’s duty to tell a patient the truth, however
unpleasant it may be. What would a man say
if his lawyer or his stockbroker lied to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which brings me to the opening of my story.
It was in the May before the War that a man came
into my consulting-room—a man whom I will
call Jack Digby. I motioned him to a chair on
the other side of my desk, so placed that the light
from the window fell on his face. I put him down
as a man of about three-and-thirty who was used
to an outdoor life. His face was bronzed, his
hands were sunburnt, and the whole way he
carried himself—the set of his shoulders, the
swing of his arms as he walked across the room—indicated
the athlete in good condition. In fact,
he was an unusual type to find in a Harley Street
consulting-room, and I told him so by way of
opening the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He grinned, a very pleasant, cheery grin,
and put his hat on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just a matter of form, Doctor,’ he said,
leaning back in his chair and crossing his legs.
‘I’m thinking of entering for the matrimonial
stakes, and before saddling-up I thought I’d just
get you to certify me sound in wind and limb.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now he spoke very easily and naturally, but
something—I don’t quite know what—made me
look at him a little more closely. The study of
human nature is a vital necessity if the study of
human ailments is to be successful—and one gets
plenty of opportunity for it if one is a consulting
physician. And I suddenly wondered if it was
‘just a matter of form’ in his mind. The
ordinary young, healthy man doesn’t usually
take the trouble to be overhauled by a doctor
merely because he is going to be married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, at that stage of the proceedings
my thoughts were my own, and I answered him
in the same vein. And while he was taking off
his coat and shirt we talked casually on various
topics. Then I started my examination. And
within half a minute I knew that something was
very, very wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I would like you to take off your vest,
please, Mr. Digby,’ I said, and for a moment he
stared at me in silence. I was watching him
quietly, and it was then I knew that my first
surmise was correct. In his eyes there was a
look of dreadful fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stripped his vest off, and I continued my
examination. And after I’d finished I walked
over to my desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You can put on your clothes again,’ I said
gravely, to swing round as I felt his hand like a
vice on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What is it?’ he muttered. ‘Tell me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It was not altogether a matter of form with
you, was it, Mr. Digby?’ I answered. ‘Put on
your clothes; I want to ask you a few questions.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hang it, man!’ he cried. ‘I can’t wait.
What have you found?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I would like to have another opinion before
telling you.’ I was fencing for time, but he was
insistent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You can have another opinion—you can
have fifty other opinions,’ he cried, still gripping
me by the shoulder—‘but I want to know what
you think <span class='it'>now</span>. Can I marry?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You cannot,’ I said gravely, and his hand
fell to his side. Then he slowly walked across the
room and stood with his back to me, staring out
of the window. Once his shoulders shook a little,
but except for that he stood quite motionless.
And after a while he picked up his clothes and
started to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said nothing until he had finished; with
a man of his type talking is a mistake. It was
not until he again sat down in the chair opposite
me that I broke the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You asked me a specific question, Mr.
Digby,’ I said quietly, ‘and I answered as a man
of your type would like to be answered. But I
now want to modify my reply slightly. And
I will put it this way. If I had a daughter,
I would not allow a man whose heart was in the
condition that yours is to marry her. It would
not be fair to her; it would certainly not be fair
to any possible children.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He nodded gravely, though he didn’t speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You feared something of this sort when you
came to me?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My mother died of it,’ he answered quietly.
‘And once or twice lately, after exercise, I’ve
had an agonising twinge of pain.’ And then,
under his breath, he added: ‘Thank God, she
doesn’t know!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But I would like another opinion,’ I continued.
‘There are men, as you know, who are
entirely heart specialists, and I will give you the
address of one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Confirmation of the death sentence,’ he
laughed grimly. ‘No saddling-up for me—eh,
Doctor?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not as you are at present, Mr. Digby.’ I
was writing the address of the biggest heart man
on a piece of paper, though I felt it was useless.
It didn’t require an expert to diagnose this
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is there any chance of getting better?’ he
cried eagerly, and I stopped writing and looked at
him. There was hope—a dawning hope in his
eyes—and for a moment I hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own opinion was that there was no
chance: that he might, with care and luck, live
for two or three years—perhaps more—but that
he might equally well drop dead at any moment.
It was enough—that momentary hesitation;
the eager look in his eyes faded, and he sat back
wearily in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t bother,’ he said slowly; ‘I see how
it is.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, you don’t, Mr. Digby,’ I answered.
‘You see how I think it is. Which is an altogether
different matter. There is always a
chance.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s juggling with words,’ he said, with
a twisted little smile. ‘The great point is that
I’m not in a position to ask this girl to marry
me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He glanced at the slip of paper I handed
to him, then he rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I would like you to go and see him,’ I said
quietly. ‘You see I feel the gravity of what
I’ve had to tell you this morning very much, and
in fairness to myself as well as to you, my dear
fellow, I’d like you to go to Sir John.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a few seconds he stood there facing me,
then he grinned as he had done at the beginning
of the interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘All right, Doctor,’ he cried. ‘I’ll go, and
Sir John shall drive the nail right in.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m sorry,’ I said—‘infernally sorry.
You’ve taken it, if I may say so, like a very
brave man.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned away abruptly. ‘What the deuce
is the good of whining?’ he cried. ‘If it’s the
same as in my mother’s case, the end will be very
abrupt.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next moment he was gone—a man under
sentence of death. And the pitiful tragedy of it
hit one like a blow. He was so essentially the
type of man who should have married some
charming girl and have children. He was just a
first-class specimen of the sporting Englishman,
but——” The Doctor paused and looked at the
Soldier. “The type that makes a first-class
squadron-leader,” and the Soldier nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in the afternoon,” continued the
Doctor after a while, “that Sir John Longworth
rang me up. Digby had been to him, and the
result was as I expected. Two years, or possibly
two days, and as for marriage, out of the
question entirely. He had merely confirmed my
own diagnosis of the case, and there for a time
the matter rested. In the stress of work Jack
Digby passed from my mind, until Fate decreed
that we should meet again in what were to prove
most dramatic circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was two months later—about the beginning
of July—that I decided to take a short
holiday. I couldn’t really spare the time, but I
knew that I ought to take one. So I ran down for
a long week-end to stop with some people I knew
fairly well in Dorsetshire. They had just taken
a big house a few miles from Weymouth, and I
will call them the Maitlands. There were Mr.
and Mrs. Maitland, and a son, Tom, up at the
’Varsity, and a daughter, Sybil. When I arrived
I found they had a bit of a house-party, perhaps
a dozen in all, and after tea the girl, whom I’d
met once or twice before, took me round the
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a charming girl, very, very pretty,
of about twenty-two or three, and we chattered
on aimlessly as we strolled through the gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re quite a big party,’ I laughed,
‘and I thought I was coming for a quiet week-end.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We’ve got two or three more arriving to-night,’
she said. ‘At least I think so. One of
them is a most elusive person.’ She was staring
straight in front of her as she spoke, and for the
moment she seemed to have forgotten my
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Male or female—the elusive one?’ I asked
lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A man,’ she answered abruptly, and
changed the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But being an old and wary bird, I read
into her harmless remark a somewhat deeper
significance than was perhaps justified, and it
struck me very forcibly that if I were the man
I would not be elusive in the circumstances. She
surely was most amazingly pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With great deductive ability,” murmured the
Actor, as the Doctor paused to refill his pipe, “we
place the elusive man as Jack Digby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go to blazes!” laughed the teller of the
story. “I haven’t got to that yet. Of course
you’re quite right—he was; though when I found
it out a little later it came as a complete surprise
to me. I’d almost forgotten his existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was her father who first mentioned his
name. I was having a sherry and bitters with
him in his study before going up to dress for
dinner, and the conversation turned on the girl.
I think I said how extraordinarily pretty I
thought she was, and remarked that I supposed
somebody would soon be walking off with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe Maitland’s face clouded a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, ‘both her
mother and I have been expecting it for some
time. A most charming man, and Sybil is in
love with him, I’m sure. We all thought that
he was in love with her,’ and then he exploded—‘damn
it, it isn’t a question of thinking, I <span class='it'>know</span>
he’s in love with her! And for some extraordinary
reason he won’t tell her so. He’s kept away
from her for the last two months, after having
lived in her pocket. And he’s not the type that
monkeys round and makes a girl fond of him for
no reason. He’s coming here to-night, and——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My host, still frowning slightly, lit a cigarette.
So evidently this was the elusive man, I thought,
putting down my glass. It was no business of
mine, and then suddenly I stood very still as I
heard him speak again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jack Digby is as white as they’re made,’
he was saying, but I didn’t hear any more.
Luckily my back was towards him, so he couldn’t
see my face. Jack Digby! Poor devil! With
Sybil Maitland, the girl, in his mind, the blow I’d
given him must have been even crueller than I’d
thought. And what a strange coincidence that
I should be going to meet him again in such
circumstances. Maitland was still rambling on,
but I was paying no attention to him. I could,
of course, say nothing unless Digby gave me
permission; but it struck me that if I told him
how the land lay—if I told him that not only
was his silence being completely misconstrued,
but that it was making the girl unhappy, he might
allow me to tell her father the truth. After all,
the truth was far better; there was nothing to be
ashamed of in having a rotten heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was just as I had made up my mind
to see Digby that night that the door opened and
Tom, the boy, came in. I hadn’t seen him since
he was quite a child, and the first thing that
struck me about him was that he was almost as
good-looking as his sister. He’d got the same
eyes, the same colouring, but—there was the
devil of a but. Whereas his sister gave one the
impression of being utterly frank and fearless,
the boy struck me immediately as being the very
reverse. That he was the apple of his mother’s
eye, I knew—but that signifies nothing. Thank
God! mothers are made that way. And as I
stood watching him talking to his father I recalled
certain vague rumours that I’d heard recently and
had paid scant attention to at the time. Rumours
of wild extravagance up at Oxford—debts well
into the four figures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They came back to my
mind, those idle bits of gossip, and they assumed
a definite significance as I studied the boy’s face.
It was weak—utterly weak; he gave one the
impression of having no mental or moral stamina
whatever. He poured himself out a glass of
sherry, and his hand wasn’t quite steady, which
is a bad sign in a boy of under twenty-one. And
he was a little frightened of his father, which is
bad in a boy of any age when the father is a man
like Joe Maitland. And that wasn’t all, either.
There was something more—something much
bigger on his mind: I was sure of it. There was
fear in his heart; you could see it lurking round
his eyes—round his mouth. I glanced at Joe,
but he seemed quite oblivious of it, and then I
left them and went up to dress for dinner. I
remember wondering as I turned into my room
whether the boy had got into another scrape—then
I dismissed him from my mind. Jack Digby
was a more interesting and more pressing
problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met him in the hall as I came down, and he
gave a sudden start of astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Doctor,’ he said quietly as we shook
hands, ‘this is a surprise. I’d no idea you were
to be here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nor I that you were coming,’ I answered,
‘until Mr. Maitland happened to mention it a
little while ago.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You haven’t said anything to him, have
you?’ he cried anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My dear fellow,’ I said, ‘you ought to know
that doctors don’t.’ He muttered an apology,
and I went on: ‘You know, Digby, I can’t help
thinking you’re making a mistake in not telling
the truth.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shook his head vigorously. ‘I’m sure
I’m not,’ he answered. ‘The mistake I’ve made
has been in coming here at all. I haven’t seen
her since the day—when you told me. And I
oughtn’t to have come now. It’s the last—I
swear that. I couldn’t help it; I had to see her
once again. I’m going to Africa in August—big
game shooting.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stared at him gravely, and after a while he
went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No one knows better than you,’ he said
gravely, ‘my chance of returning. And when I
don’t come back—she’ll forget me.’ I saw his
hands clench at his side. ‘But if I tell her now—why,
she’ll want me to stop in England—to go
to specialists—to eke out life to the full two or
three years. It’ll be hell—hell! Hell for both of
us. Every day she’ll be wondering if she is going
to hear I’m dead; it’ll ruin her life. Whereas
Africa, if she doesn’t know about my heart,
will be sudden. You see, Doctor, she is the only
one to be considered—the only one.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I drew a deep breath; truly Joe Maitland
had been right. This man was white clean
through. And then he gave a little choking gasp,
and, turning round, I saw the girl coming towards
us across the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I didn’t know you’d come, old man,’ I
heard her say, and then I moved away and left
them. It was one of those occasions when you
say it’s the smoke that has got into your eyes—and
you lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the Doctor was silent; then he
gave a short laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sat next to one another at dinner,
opposite me, and I’m afraid my partner must
have thought I was a little wanting in intellect.
They were such a perfectly ideal couple; and
I noticed old Joe Maitland watching them every
now and then. But gradually, as the meal
progressed, a puzzled look began to creep into
the girl’s eyes, and once she bit her lip suddenly
and turned abruptly to the man on her other side.
It was then that Digby looked across the table
at me, and in that moment I realised that he was
right. For him to remain in England would be
impossible for both of them; the end, quick
and sudden in an African jungle—if he ever got
as far—was the only way out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My God! Doctor,’ he said as he came
round and sat down next to me after the
ladies had gone, ‘I knew I was a fool to come,
but I didn’t think it was going to be as bad
as this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘When are you going to start?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘As soon as I can get things fixed up at home,
here, and make some sort of arrangements for
carriers and people the other end. One must act,
I suppose, even though it’s the last appearance.’
He gave a mirthless laugh. ‘I’ve always wanted
to go South from Khartoum—I wonder how far
I’ll get.’ Then he began to drum on the table
with his fingers. ‘And what I wonder still more,’
he went on slowly, ‘is how in Heaven’s name I’ll
get through this evening. You see, though I didn’t
actually propose in so many words before I came to
see you, I’d—I’d let things drift to such a position
that a proposal was hardly necessary. That’s
the devil of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She knows I worship the
ground she walks on—and I know she cares too.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How long are you going to stop here?’
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I accepted for the week-end,’ he said
abruptly. ‘I shall go first thing to-morrow. I
can’t stand it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At that we left it, and I didn’t speak to him
again until the thing occurred which even now—though
seven years have slipped by—is as clearly
imprinted on my brain as if it had happened
last night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t sleep very well that night, and at
about two I switched on my light, with the idea of
reading. I was just reaching out for a book when
I heard the sound of voices from a room almost
opposite. I listened for a moment, then I got
up and went to the door. For the voices were
excited and angry; something unusual was
evidently happening. For a moment or two I
hesitated; then I slipped on a dressing-gown and
looked out. Across the passage the door of a
room was open, and through it the light was
streaming out. And then I heard Joe Maitland
speak, and his words literally rooted me to the
ground with amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So, Mr. Digby, you’re just a common
damned thief. The gentleman crook—what?
The amateur cracksman. That’s what they call
them on the stage, I believe. Sounds better.
But I prefer the more homely name of thief.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then that I appeared in the door, and
Maitland swung round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, it’s you, is it, Tranton?’ He had a
revolver in his hand, and he lowered it when he
saw who it was. ‘A pretty tableau, isn’t it?
It appears that a second edition of—what was the
gentleman’s name—Raffles, wasn’t it?—has been
honouring me with his presence. Unfortunately,
Tom and I both happened to hear him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I was paying no attention to what he
was saying; my eyes were fixed on Digby and—Tom.
Digby, with a quiet smile on his face and
his hands in his pockets, was standing beside an
open safe. He was still in evening clothes, and
once he glanced my way. Then he looked back
again at his host, and I looked at Tom. He was
in his dressing-gown, and he was shivering as if he
had the ague. He was standing close to his
father, and a little behind him—and Joe Maitland
was too engrossed with Digby to notice the condition
he was in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can you advance any reason, Mr. Digby,’
he demanded, ‘why I shouldn’t call up the local
police?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘None whatever, Mr. Maitland,’ he answered
gravely. ‘Your son caught me fair and square.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it seemed to me that Tom made an effort
to speak, though no words came from his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You damned scoundrel!’ cried Maitland.
‘You come to my house—you make love to my
daughter—and then you abuse my hospitality by
trying to steal my wife’s jewellery!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was at that moment that the girl came in.
I saw Digby catch his breath and lean against
the wall for support; then he straightened up
and faced his host again. Just once had he
glanced at her, with her glorious hair falling over
her shoulders and a startled look of wonder in her
great eyes. Then resolutely he looked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What’s happened, Daddy?’ she whispered.
‘I heard your voice and——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This has happened, my dear,’ said Maitland
grimly. ‘We have been privileged to discover
Mr. Digby’s method of earning a livelihood.’ He
pointed to the open safe. ‘He apparently
ingratiates himself with people for the express
purpose of stealing their valuables. In other
words, a common thief.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t believe it!’ she flashed out,
imperiously. ‘Jack—a thief! How can you
say such a thing?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then may I ask what he was doing when
your brother discovered him by the open safe?
Besides, he admits it himself.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jack!’ The cry seemed to come from the
very depths of her soul. ‘Say it’s a lie!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one second he hesitated; then he spoke
quite steadily, though he didn’t look at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am afraid, Miss Maitland—that I can’t
say it’s untrue.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then there fell one of those silences that
can be felt. She was staring at Jack Digby, was
the girl—staring at him with a great amazement
dawning on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jack,’ she whispered, ‘look at me!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He raised his eyes and looked at her, and a
little pulse was beating just above his jaw. Then,
after what seemed an interminable time, she gave
a little laugh that was half a sob and turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I see,’ she said below her breath. ‘I see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what it was she saw, I didn’t at the
moment realise. It was to be made clear a little
later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor paused and threw a log on the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I found out later what she thought,”
he went on after a while, “and for the first and
probably the last time in my life I was guilty of a
breach of professional confidence. It was about
half an hour later that I went round to Jack
Digby’s room. Maitland, after thinking it over—and
it is possible that I had something to do with
his decision—had dismissed the idea of sending
for the police. Digby was to clear out by the
first train next morning, and was never to make
an attempt to communicate with the girl again.
And Jack Digby had bowed in silence and gone
to his own room. He wouldn’t look at me as he
passed; I think he knew that he hadn’t deceived
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was sitting by the open window when I
went in, still in his evening clothes, and he looked
round with a start as I entered. His face was
drawn and grey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My dear chap,’ I said, before he could speak,
‘is it worth while?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t understand what you mean, Doctor,’
he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, yes, you do!’ I answered. ‘You
deceived Mr. Maitland all right—you didn’t
deceive me. It was Tom who opened the safe—not
you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment I thought he was going to
deny it; then he gave a little mirthless laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perfectly correct,’ he said. ‘As you say,
it was Tom who opened the safe. I caught him
absolutely in the act. And then Mr. Maitland
came.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But—good God!’ I cried, ‘what an unutterable
young waster he must be to let you
shoulder the blame!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Digby faced me steadily. ‘I made him.
You see, I saw it was the chance I had been
looking for.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You mean you told him about your heart?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ he answered quietly. ‘But I told him
I was entangled with another woman, and that
the best way of saving his sister’s feelings was to
let her think——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the boy broke down utterly. With
his hands on my shoulders he stood there facing
me, and he made me swear I wouldn’t tell the
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She must never know, Doctor. I’ve done
it for her. She must never know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And even as he spoke, the words died away
on his lips, and he stood motionless, staring past
me at the door. Without looking round I knew
what had happened—I could smell the faint scent
she used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What have you done for me, Jack, and why
must I never know?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came steadily up to him, and his hands
fell to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, you’ve been crying, dear,’ she said.
‘What’s the matter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True to his purpose, he started some fantastic
story about sorrow at having been found out, but
she cut him short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t lie, Jack—not now,’ she whispered.
‘I know it wasn’t you who opened the safe. I
know it was Tom. But what I want to know is
why you said you did it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then I made up my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m going to tell her, Digby, whether you
like it or not,’ and she looked at me quickly. He
didn’t say anything; things had got beyond him.
And very briefly I told her the truth about his
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She listened to me in absolute silence, and
when I’d finished she just turned round to him
and held out both her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thank God! I know, my darling,’ she
whispered. ‘I thought it was because you’d got
fond of another woman. I thought—oh!
Heaven knows what I thought! But now—oh!
you stupid, wonderful boy!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to the window and looked out! It
must have been five minutes later that I found
the girl at my side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is it absolutely hopeless?’ she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Humanly speaking,’ I answered, ‘yes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How long?’ and she put her hand on my
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Two days; two months; at the utmost,
two years,’ I said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And why shouldn’t I look after him for those
two years?’ she demanded fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m thinking of a possible child,’ I said
quietly, and she began to tremble a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s ridiculous,’ she cried—‘quite ridiculous.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor was carefully cleaning out the bowl
of his pipe. “In the morning Jack Digby had
gone, leaving behind him a note for her. She
showed it to me later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The Doctor is right, my darling,’ it ran.
‘It’s just Fate, and there’s not much use kicking.
I’m glad though that you know the truth—it
helps. Good-bye, dear heart. God bless you.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all?” said the Ordinary Man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nearly,” answered the Doctor. “I had
been right when I said two months, only the cause
of death was not what I expected. How he got
across the water so soon I don’t know. But he
did—in a cavalry regiment. And he stopped one—somewhere
up Ypres way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the girl?” asked the Soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has not got over it yet,” said the Doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did she ever hear from him again?”
demanded the Barrister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, from France. Written just before—the
end. She didn’t show me <span class='it'>that</span> one. Pass the
whisky, Actor-man. Talking makes one’s throat
infernally dry.”</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Any</span> of you know Burma?” asked the
Ordinary Man, putting out his hand for the
tobacco-jar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been there,” grunted the Soldier.
“Shooting. Years ago. West of the Irawadi
from Rangoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s years since I was there, too,” said the
Ordinary Man. “More than a score. And if I
wasn’t so beastly fat and lazy I’d like to go back
for a visit. Only a visit, mind you. I’ve got to
the time of life when I find that London is quite
good enough for my needs. But the story which
I propose to inflict on you fellows to-night concerns
Burma, and delving into the past to get the
details right has brought the fascination of the
place back to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was about thirty-five at the time—and my
benevolent Aunt Jane had not then expired and
endowed me with all her worldly goods. I was
working for a City firm who had considerable
interests out there—chiefly teak, with a strong
side-line in rubies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At that time, as you may know, the ruby
mines in the Mandalay area were second to none,
and it was principally to give my employers
a report on the many clashing interests in those
mines that I went back to England after a few
months in the country. And it was in their
office that I met a youngster, who had just joined
the firm, and who, it turned out, was going out to
Burma on the same boat as myself. Jack
Manderby was his name, and I suppose he must
have been ten or eleven years younger than I.
He was coming to my district, and somewhat
naturally I was a bit curious to see what sort of a
fellow he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took to him from the very first moment,
and after we’d lunched together a couple of times
my first impression was strengthened. He was a
real good fellow—extraordinarily good-looking
and straight as a die, without being in the least
degree a prig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ran into a good south-westerly gale the
instant we were clear of the Isle of Wight, which
necessitated a period of seclusion on my part.
In fact, my next appearance in public was at
Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the first person I saw as I came on deck
was Jack Manderby. He was leaning over the
side bargaining with some infernal robber below,
and at his side was a girl. In the intervals of
haggling he turned to her, and they both laughed;
and as I stood for a few minutes watching them,
it struck me that Master Jack had made good use
of the four days since we left England. Then I
strolled over and joined them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hullo, old man!’ he cried, with a twinkle
in his eyes. ‘Is the rumour correct that you’ve
been engaged in research work below, and had
given orders not to be disturbed?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Your vulgar jests leave me unmoved,’ I
answered with dignity. ‘At any rate, I appear
to have arrived in time to save you being robbed.
That man is a thief and the son of a thief, and all
his children are thieves.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack laughed; then he swung round to the
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘By the way, you haven’t met Mr. Walton,
have you? This is Miss Felsted, old boy, who
is going out to Rangoon.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shook hands, and no more was said
at the time. But one thing was definitely certain.
Whatever the girl was going to Rangoon for, the
gain was Rangoon’s. She was an absolute
fizzer—looked you straight in the face with the
bluest of eyes that seemed to have a permanent
smile lurking in them. And then, suddenly, I
noticed her left hand. On the third finger was a
diamond ring. It couldn’t be Jack she was
engaged to, and I wondered idly who the lucky
man was. Because he was lucky—infernally
lucky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” continued the Ordinary Man,
pulling thoughtfully at his pipe, “that I first
began to scent complications at Malta. We
landed there for a few hours, and the idea was
that Miss Felsted, Jack, and I should explore
Valetta. Now, I don’t quite know how, but we
got separated. I spent a pleasant two hours with
a naval pal in the Union Club, while Jack and
the girl apparently went up by the narrow-gauge
railway to Citta Vecchia, in the centre of the
island. And since no one in the full possession
of their senses would go on that line for fun,
I wondered. I wondered still more when they
came back to the ship. Jack was far too open
and above-board to be very skilful at hiding his
feelings. And something had happened that
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, it was no concern of mine. Jack’s
affairs were entirely his own; so were the girl’s.
But a ship is a dangerous place sometimes—it
affords unequalled and unending opportunities
for what in those days were known as flirtations,
and to-day, I believe, are known as ‘pashes.’ And
to get monkeying round with another fellow’s
fiancée—well, it leads to complications generally.
However, as I said, it was no concern of mine,
until it suddenly became so the evening before we
reached Port Said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talking to Jack on deck just before
turning in. We were strolling up and down—the
sea like a mill-pond, and almost dazzling with
its phosphorescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is Miss Felsted going out to get married?’
I asked him casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ he answered abruptly. ‘She’s engaged
to a man called Morrison.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Morrison,’ I repeated, stopping and staring
at him. ‘Not Rupert Morrison, by any chance?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes. Rupert is his name. Do you know
him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d pulled myself together by this time, and
we resumed our stroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know Rupert Morrison quite well,’ I
answered. ‘As distance goes in that country,
Jack, he’s a near neighbour of ours’; and I
heard him catch his breath a little quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What sort of a fellow is he?’ asked Jack
quietly, and then he went on, which saved me the
trouble of a reply: ‘She hasn’t seen him for four
years. They got engaged before he left England,
and now she’s going out to marry him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I see,’ I murmured non-committally, and
shortly afterwards I made my excuse and left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t turn in at once when I got to my
cabin, I wanted to try and get things sorted out
in my mind. The first point, which was as
obvious as the electric light over the bunk, was
that if Jack Manderby was not in love with Molly
Felsted he was as near to it as made no odds.
The second and far more important point was
one on which I was in the dark—was the girl in
love with him? If so, it simplified matters considerably;
but if not, if she was only playing
the fool, there was going to be trouble when we
got to Burma. And the trouble would take the
form of Rupert Morrison. For the more I
thought of it the more amazed did I become that
such a girl could ever have become engaged to
such a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, four years is a long time, especially
when they are passed in comparative solitude.
I had no idea what sort of fellow Morrison had
been when first he arrived in the country, but I
had a very shrewd idea what manner of man he
was now. Perhaps it had been the loneliness—loneliness
takes some men worse than others—but,
whatever the cause, Morrison, after four
years in Burma, was no fit mate for such a girl
as Molly Felsted. A brooding, sullen man,
given to fierce fits of almost animal rage, a heavy
drinker of the type who is never drunk, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ordinary Man paused and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s unfair to mention the last point.
After all, most of us did that without thinking;
but the actual arrival of an English girl—a wife—who
was to step, blindly ignorant, into her
predecessor’s shoes, so to speak, made one pause
to think. Anyway, that was neither here nor
there. What frightened me was the prospect of
the girl marrying the Morrison of her imagination
and discovering, too late, the Morrison of reality.
When that happened, with Jack Manderby not
five miles away, the fat was going to be in the fire
with a vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was after Colombo that matters came to a
head. We left the P. &amp; O. there, and got into
another boat going direct to Rangoon. The
weather was glorious—hot as blazes by day, and
just right at night. And it was after dinner one
evening a couple of days before we were due in,
that quite inadvertently I butted into the pair of
them in a secluded spot on deck. His arms were
round her, and they both sounded a bit incoherent.
Of course, there was no use pretending
I hadn’t seen—they both looked up at me. I
could only mutter my apology and withdraw.
But I determined, even at the risk of being told
to go to hell, to have a word with young Jack
that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look here, old man,’ I said to him a bit
later, ‘you’ve got a perfect right to request me
to mind my own business, but I’m going to risk
that. I saw you two to-night, kissing to beat the
band—confound it all, there wasn’t a dog’s
earthly of not seeing you—and what I want to
know is where Morrison comes in, or if he’s gone
out?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looked at me a bit shamefacedly, then
he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hugh,’ he said, with a twisted sort of smile,
‘I just worship the ground that girl walks on.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Maybe you do, Jack,’ I answered. ‘But
the point is, what are her feelings on the matter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t answer, and after a while I went
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘This show is not my palaver,’ I said
ordering two whisky pegs from the bartender.
‘It’s nothing to do with me, except that you and
I are going to share the same bungalow, which is
within easy calling distance of Morrison’s. Now,
Morrison is a funny-tempered fellow, but, apart
from that altogether, the situation seems strained
to me. If she breaks off her engagement with him
and marries you, well and good. But if she isn’t
going to do that, if she still intends to marry
Morrison—well, then, old man, although I hold
no brief for him, you’re not playing the game.
I’m no sky pilot, but do one thing or the other.
Things are apt to happen, you know, Jack, when
one’s at the back of beyond and a fellow gets
playing around with another fellow’s wife—things
which might make an English court of justice sit
up and scratch its head.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He heard me out in silence, then he nodded
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I know it must seem to you that I wasn’t
playing the game,’ he said quietly. ‘But,
believe me, it’s not for want of asking on my part
that Molly won’t marry me. And I believe
that she’s as fond of me—almost—as I am of
her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then why the——?’ I began, but he
stopped me with a weary little gesture of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She feels that she’s bound to him in
honour,’ he went on. ‘I’ve told her that there
can’t be much question of honour if she doesn’t
love him any more, but she seems to think that,
as he has waited four years for her, she can’t
break her bargain. And she’s very fond of him;
if it hadn’t been for fate chucking us together
she would never have thought of not marrying
him. To-night we both forgot ourselves, I
suppose; it won’t occur again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sat back staring out of the port-hole.
The smoke-room was empty, and I fairly let
myself go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You very silly idiot,’ I exploded, ‘do you
imagine I’ve been delivering a homily on the sins
of kissing another man’s fiancée. What I want
to get into your fat head is this. You’re going
to a place where the only white woman you’ll
see from year’s end to year’s end is that girl, if
she marries Morrison. You can prattle about
honour, and forgetting yourselves, and not letting
it occur again, and it’s worth the value of that
used match. Sooner or later it will occur again,
and it won’t stop at kissing next time. And then
Morrison will probably kill you, or you’ll kill him,
and there’ll be the devil to pay. For Heaven’s
sake, man, look the thing square in the face.
Either marry the girl, or cut her right out of your
life. And you can only do that by cabling the
firm—or I’ll cable them for you from Rangoon—asking
to be posted to another district. I shall
be sorry, but I’d far rather lose you than sit
on the edge of a young volcano.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left him to chew over what I’d said and
went to bed, feeling infernally sorry for both of
them. But the one fact over which there was no
doubt whatever in my mind was that if Morrison
married Molly Felsted, then Jack Manderby
would have to be removed as far as geographically
possible from temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My remarks apparently had some effect,
because the next day Jack buttonholed me on
deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ve told Molly what you said last night,
old man, and we’ve been talking it over. Morrison
is meeting her apparently at Rangoon, and she
has agreed to tell him what has happened. And
when he knows how the land lies it’s bound to be
all right. Of course, I’m sorry for him, poor
devil, but——’ and he went babbling on in a way
common to those in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I didn’t pay much attention; I
was thinking of Morrison and wondering whether
Jack’s optimism was justified. Apart from his
moroseness and drinking, there were other stories
about the man—stories which are not good to
hear about a white man. I’d never paid any
heed to them before, but now they came back
to me—those rumours of strange things, which
only the ignorant sceptic pretends to scorn;
strange things done in secret with native priests
and holy men; strange things it is not well for the
white man to dabble in. And someone had it
that Rupert Morrison did more than dabble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ordinary Man paused and sipped his
whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He met the boat at Rangoon,” he continued
after a while, “and came on board. Evidently
the girl wasted no time in telling him what had
occurred, because it was barely ten minutes before
I saw him coming towards Jack and myself.
There was a smouldering look in his eyes, but
outwardly he seemed quite calm. He gave me
a curt nod, then he addressed himself exclusively
to Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Miss Felsted has just made a somewhat
unexpected announcement to me,’ he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack bowed gravely. ‘I am more than sorry,
Mr. Morrison,’ he said, ‘if it should appear to you
that I have acted in any way caddishly.’ He
paused a little constrainedly and I moved away.
The presence of a third person at such an interview
helps nobody. But once or twice I glanced
at them during the next quarter of an hour,
and it seemed to me that, though he was trying
to mask it, the look of smouldering fury in
Morrison’s eyes was growing more pronounced.
From their attitude it struck me that Jack was
protesting against some course of action on which
the other was insisting, and I turned out to be
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Morrison has made the following proposal,’
he said irritably to me when their conversation
had finished. ‘That Molly should be left here
in Rangoon with the English chaplain and his
wife—apparently he’d fixed that already—and
that we—he and I—should both go up country
for a month or six weeks. Neither of us to see
her during that time, and at the end of it she to be
free to choose. As he pointed out, I suppose
quite rightly, he had been engaged to her for more
than four years, and it was rather rough on him to
upset everything for what might prove only a
passing fancy, induced by being thrown together
on board ship. Of course, I pointed out to him
that this was no question of a passing fancy—but
he insisted.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And you agreed?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What else could I do?’ he cried. ‘Heaven
knows I didn’t want to—it’s such awful rot and
waste of time. But I suppose it is rather
rough luck on the poor devil, and if it makes it
any easier for him to have the agony prolonged
a few weeks, it’s up to me to give him that
satisfaction.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went off to talk to the girl, leaving me
smoking a cigarette thoughtfully; for, try as I
would, I could not rid my mind of the suspicion
that there was something behind this suggestion
of Morrison’s—something sinister. Fortunately,
Jack would be under my eye—in my bungalow;
but even so, I felt uneasy. Morrison had been
too quiet for safety, bearing in mind what manner
of man he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We landed shortly after and I went round
to the club. I didn’t see Morrison—he seemed
to have disappeared shortly after his interview
with Jack; but he had given the girl full
directions as to how to get to the chaplain’s house.
Jack took her there, and I’d arranged with him
that he should come round after and join me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first man I ran into was McAndrew—a
leather-faced Scotsman from up my part of the
country—who was down in Rangoon on business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Seen the bridegroom?’ he grunted as soon
as he saw me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Travelled out with the bride,’ I said briefly,
not over-anxious to discuss the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And what sort of a lassie is she?’ he asked
curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perfectly charming,’ I answered, ringing
the bell for a waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is that so?’ he said slowly, and our eyes
met. ‘Man,’ he added still more slowly, ‘it
should not be, it should not be. Poor lassie!
Poor lassie!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then Jack Manderby came in, and I
introduced him to two or three other fellows.
I’d arranged to go up country that evening—train
to Mandalay, and ride from there the
following morning—and Jack, of course, was
coming with me. He had said good-bye to the
girl; he wasn’t going to see her again before he
went up country, and we spent the latter part of
the afternoon pottering round Rangoon. And it
was as we were strolling down one of the native
bazaars that he suddenly caught my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look—there’s Morrison!’ he muttered.
‘I distinctly saw his face peering out of that
shop.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked in the direction he was pointing.
It was an ordinary native shop where one could
buy ornaments and musical instruments and
trash like that—but of Morrison I could see no
sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t see him,’ I said; ‘and anyway there
is no reason why he shouldn’t be in the shop
if he wants to.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But he suddenly vanished,’ persisted Jack,
‘as if he didn’t want to be seen.’ He walked on
with me slowly. ‘I don’t like that man, Hugh;
I hate the swine. And it’s not because of Molly,
either.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shut up at that, and I did not pursue the
topic. It struck me that we should have quite
enough of Morrison in the next few weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ordinary Man paused and lit a cigarette;
then he smiled a little grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what I expected,” he continued
thoughtfully: “I certainly never said a word
to Jack as to my vague suspicions. But all the
time during the first fortnight, while he was
settling down into the job, I had the feeling that
there was danger in the air. And then, when
nothing happened, my misgivings began to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, I said to myself, what could happen,
anyway? And perhaps I had misjudged Rupert
Morrison. On the two or three occasions that
we met him he seemed perfectly normal; and
though, somewhat naturally, he was not over
effusive to Jack, that was hardly to be wondered
at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then one morning Jack came to breakfast
looking as if he hadn’t slept very well. I glanced
at him curiously, but made no allusion to his
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did you hear that music all through the
night?’ he said irritably, half-way through the
meal. ‘Some infernal native playing a pipe or
something just outside my window.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why didn’t you shout at him to stop?’
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I did. And I got up and looked.’ He took
a gulp of tea; then he looked at me as if he
were puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There was no one there that I could see.
Only something black that moved over the compound,
about the size of a kitten.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He was probably just inside the jungle
beyond the clearing,’ I said. ‘Heave half a
brick at him if you hear it again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We said no more, and I dismissed the matter
from my mind. I was on the opposite side of the
bungalow, and it would take more than a native
playing on a pipe to keep me awake. But the
following night the same thing happened—and
the next, and the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What sort of a noise is it?’ I asked him.
‘Surely to Heaven you’re sufficiently young and
healthy not to be awakened by a bally fellow
whistling?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It isn’t that that wakes me, Hugh,’ he
answered slowly. ‘I wake before it starts. Each
night about the same time I suddenly find myself
wide awake—listening. Sometimes it’s ten minutes
before it starts—sometimes almost at once;
but it always comes. A faint, sweet whistle—three
or four notes, going on and on—until I
think I’ll go mad. It seems to be calling me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But why the devil don’t you go and see
what it is?’ I cried peevishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because’—and he stared at me with a
shamefaced expression in his eyes—‘because I
daren’t.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Rot!’ I said angrily. ‘Look here, young
fellow, nerves are bad things anywhere—here
they’re especially bad. You pull yourself
together.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He flushed all over his face, and shut up like
an oyster, which made me rather sorry I’d spoke
so sharply. But one does hear funny noises in
the jungle, and it doesn’t do to become fanciful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then one evening McAndrew came
over to dinner. It was during the meal that I
mentioned Jack’s nocturnal serenader, expecting
that Mac would treat it as lightly as I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Seven times you’ve heard him, Jack,
haven’t you,’ I said, ‘and always the same
tune?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Always the same tune,’ he answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can you whistle it now?’ asked McAndrew,
laying down his knife and fork and staring at
Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Easily,’ said Jack. ‘It goes like this’—and
he whistled about six notes. ‘On and on it
goes—never varying——Why, McAndrew,
what the devil is the matter?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I glanced at McAndrew in amazement; then
out of the corner of my eye I saw the native
servant, who was shivering like a jelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Man—are you sure?’ said Mac, and his face
was white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Of course I’m sure,’ answered Jack quietly.
‘Why?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That tune you whistled—is not good for a
white man to hear.’ The Scotsman seemed
strangely uneasy. ‘And ye’ve heard it seven
nights? Do you know it, Walton?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not,’ I said grimly. ‘What’s the
mystery?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But McAndrew was shaking his head dourly,
and for a while he did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mind ye,’ he said at length, ‘I’m not saying
there’s anything in it at all, but I would not care
to hear that whistled outside my window. I
heard it once—years ago—when I was ’way up in
the Arakan Mountains. Soft and sweet it was—rising
and falling in the night air, and going on
ceaselessly. ’Way up above me was a monastery,
one into which no white man has ever been. And
the noise was coming from there. I had to go;
my servants wouldn’t stop. And when I asked
them why, they told me that the priests were
calling for a sacrifice. If they stopped, they told
me, it might be one of us. That no one could tell
how Death would come, or to whom, but come it
must—when the Pipes of Death were heard.
And the tune you whistled, Manderby, was the
tune the Pipes of Death were playing.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But that’s all bunkum, Mac,’ I said angrily.
‘We’re not in the Arakans here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Maybe,’ he answered doggedly. ‘But I’m
a Highlander, and—I would not care to hear that
tune.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could see Jack was impressed; as a matter
of fact I was myself—more than I cared to
admit. Sounds rot here, I know, but out there,
with the dim-lit forest around one, it was
different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McAndrew was stopping with us that night.
Jack, with the stubbornness of the young, had
flatly refused to change his room, and turned in
early, while Mac and I sat up talking. And it
was not till we went to bed ourselves that I again
alluded to the whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You don’t really think it meant anything,
Mac, do you?’ I asked him, and he shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Maybe it is just a native who has heard
it,’ he said guardedly, and further than that he
refused to commit himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it was about two o’clock when I
was awakened by a hand being thrust through
my mosquito curtains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Walton, come at once!’ It was McAndrew’s
voice, and it was shaking. ‘There’s
devil’s work going on, I tell you—devil’s work.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was up in a flash, and together we crept
along the passage towards Jack’s room. Almost
instinctively I’d picked up a gun, and I held it
ready as we paused by the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do you hear it?’ whispered Mac a little
fearfully, and I nodded. Sweet and clear the
notes rose and fell, on and on and on in the same
cadence. Sometimes the whistler seemed to be
far away, at others almost in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s the tune,’ muttered McAndrew, as we
tiptoed towards the bed. ‘The Pipes of Death.
Are ye awake, boy?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he gave a little cry and gripped
my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In God’s name,’ he whispered, ‘what’s that
on the pillow beside his head?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a while in the dim light I couldn’t make
out. There was something big and black and
motionless on the white pillow, and I crept
nearer to see what it was. And then suddenly
seemed to stand still. I saw two beady, unwinking
eyes staring at Jack’s face close by;
I saw Jack’s eyes wide open and sick with terror,
staring at the thing which shared his bed. And
still the music went on outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What is it?’ I muttered through dry lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Give me your gun, man,’ whispered McAndrew
hoarsely. ‘If the pipes stop, the boy’s
doomed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slowly he raised the gun an inch at a time,
pushing the muzzle forward with infinite care
towards the malignant, glowing eyes, until at
last the gun was almost touching its head. And at
that moment the music died away and stopped
altogether. I had the momentary glimpse of two
black feelers shooting out towards Jack’s face—then
came the crack of the gun. And with a little
sob Jack rolled out of bed and lay on the floor
half-fainting, while the black mass on the pillow
writhed and writhed and then grew still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We struck a light, and stared at what was
left of the thing in silence. And it was Jack who
spoke first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I woke,’ he said unsteadily, ‘to feel something
crawling over me on the bed. Outside that
infernal whistling was going on, and at last I
made out what was—what was——My God!’
he cried thickly, ‘what was it, Mac—what was
it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Steady, boy!’ said McAndrew. ‘It’s dead
now, anyway. But it was touch and go. I’ve
seen ’em bigger than that up in the Arakans.
It’s a bloodsucking, poisonous spider. They’re
sacred to some of the sects.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suddenly out of the jungle came one dreadful,
piercing cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What was that?’ Jack muttered, and
McAndrew shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well find out to-morrow,’ he said. ‘There
are strange things abroad to-night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We saw the darkness out—the three of us—round
a bottle of whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They’ve been trying to get you for a week,
Manderby,’ said the Scotsman. ‘To-night they
very near succeeded.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But why?’ cried Jack. ‘I’ve never done
’em any harm.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McAndrew shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t ask me that,’ he answered. ‘Their
ways are not our ways.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Has that brute been in my room every
night?’ the boy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Every night,’ answered McAndrew gravely.
‘Probably two of them. They hunt them in
pairs. They starve ’em, and then, when the
music stops, they feed.’ He thoughtfully poured
out some more whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then at last came the dawn, and we went
out to investigate. It was Jack who found him.
The face was puffed and horrible, and as we
approached, something black, about the size of a
big kitten, moved away from the body and
shambled sluggishly into the undergrowth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re safe, boy,’ said McAndrew slowly.
‘It was not the priests at all. Just murder—plain
murder.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with that he took his handkerchief and
covered the dreadful, staring eyes of Rupert
Morrison.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“You</span> can set your minds at rest about one
thing, you fellows,” began the Soldier, with a
grin. “My yarn isn’t about the war. There
have been quite enough lies told already about
that performance without my adding to the
number. No; my story concerns peace soldiering,
and, strangely enough, I had an ocular
demonstration when dining at the Ritz two nights
ago that everything had finished up quite satisfactorily,
in the approved story-book manner.
At least, when I say quite satisfactorily—there
was a price, and it was paid by one of the principal
actors. But that is the unchangeable rule:
one can but shrug one’s shoulders and pay
accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The regiment—I was a squadron-leader at
the time—was quartered at Murchester. Not a
bad station at all: good shooting, very fair
hunting, especially if you didn’t scorn the carted
stag, polo, and most excellent cricket. Also
some delightful houses in the neighbourhood;
and as we’d just come home from our foreign
tour we found the place greatly to our liking.
London was an hour and a bit by train; in fact,
there are many worse stations in England than
the spot I have labelled Murchester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only fly in the ointment when we first
arrived was a fairly natural one, and a thing
which only time could cure. The men were a
bit restive. We’d been abroad, don’t forget,
for more than ten years—India, Egypt, South
Africa—and the feel of the old country under
their feet unsettled ’em temporarily. Nothing
very bad, but an epidemic of absence without
leave and desertion broke out, and the officers
had to settle down to pull things together.
Continual courts-martial for desertion don’t do a
regiment any good with the powers that be, and
we had to stop it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, one of the first things to look to,
when any trouble of that sort is occurring, is the
general type and standard of your N.C.O.’s. In
my squadron they were good, though just a little
on the young side. I remember one day I discussed
the matter pretty thoroughly with the
squadron sergeant-major—an absolute top-notcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They’re all right, sir,’ he said. ‘In another
two or three years there will be none better in the
British Army. Especially Trevor.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah! Sergeant-Major,’ I said, looking him
straight in the face, ‘you think Trevor is a good
man, do you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The best we’ve got, sir,’ he answered quietly,
and he stared straight back at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You weren’t so sure when he first came,’
I reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, I reckon there was a bit of jealousy,
sir,’ he replied, ‘his coming in from the link
regiment over a good many of the chaps’ heads.
But he’s been with us now three months—and we
know him better.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I wish I could say the same,’ I answered.
‘He defeats me, does Sergeant Trevor.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Sergeant-Major smiled quietly. ‘Does
he, sir? I shouldn’t have thought he would
have. That there bloke Kipling has written
about the likes of Trevor.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Kipling has written a good deal about the
Army,’ I said, with an answering smile. ‘Mulvaney
and Co. are classics.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s not Mulvaney I’m meaning, sir,’ he
answered. ‘But didn’t he write a little bit of
poetry about “Gentlemen-rankers out on the
spree”?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, yes, he did.’ I lit a cigarette
thoughtfully. ‘I’d guessed that much, Manfield.
Is Trevor his real name?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know, sir,’ and at that moment
the subject of our discussion walked past and
saluted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sergeant Trevor,’ I called after him, on the
spur of the moment, and he came up at the
double. I hadn’t anything really to say to him,
but ever since he’d joined us he’d puzzled me, and
though, as the sergeant-major said, the other
non-commissioned officers might know him
better, I certainly didn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re a bit of a cricketer, aren’t you?’
I said, as he came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A faint smile flickered across his face at my
question. ‘I used to play quite a lot, sir,’ he
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good; we want to get games going really
strong.’ I talked with them both—squadron
‘shop’—a bit longer, and all the time I was trying
to probe behind the impassive mask of Trevor’s
face. Incidentally, I think he knew it; once or
twice I caught a faint gleam of amusement in his
eyes—a gleam that seemed to me a little weary.
And when I left them and went across the parade
ground towards the mess, his face haunted me.
I hadn’t probed—not the eighth of an inch;
he was still as much a mystery as ever. But he’d
got a pair of deep blue eyes, and though I wasn’t
a girl to be attracted by a man’s eyes, I couldn’t
get his out of my mind. They baffled me; the
man himself baffled me—and I’ve always disliked
being baffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a few nights after, in mess, that the
next piece in the puzzle came along. We had in
the regiment—he was killed in the war, poor
devil!—a fellow of the name of Blenton, a fairly
senior captain. He wasn’t in my squadron, and
his chief claim to notoriety was as a cricketer.
Had he been able to play regularly he would have
been easily up to first-class form—as it was he
periodically turned out for the county; but
he used to go in first wicket down for the Army.
So you can gather his sort of form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was over the port that the conversation
cropped up, and it interested me because it
was about Trevor. As far as cricket was concerned
I hardly knew which end of a bat one
held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dog-face has got a winner,’ I heard Blenton
say across the table. I may say that I answered
to that tactful sobriquet, for reasons into which
we need not enter. ‘One Sergeant Trevor in
your squadron, old boy,’ he turned to me. ‘I
was watching him at the nets to-night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is he any good?’ I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My dear fellow,’ answered Blenton, deliberately,
‘he is out and away the best bat we’ve had
in the regiment for years. He’s up to Army
form!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who’s that?’ demanded the commanding
officer, sitting up and taking notice at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sergeant Trevor in B squadron, Colonel,’
said Blenton. ‘I was watching him this evening
at nets. Of course, the bowling was tripe, but
he’s in a completely different class to the average
soldier cricketer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did you talk to him?’ I asked, curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I did. And he struck me as being singularly
uncommunicative. Asked him where he learnt
his cricket, and he hummed and hawed, and
finally said he’d played a lot in his village before
joining the Army. I couldn’t quite make him
out, Dog-face. And why the devil didn’t he play
for us out in Jo’burg?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because he only joined a couple of months
before we sailed,’ I answered. ‘Came with that
last draft we got.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, I wish we had a few more trained in
his village,’ said Blenton. ‘We could do with
them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After mess, I tackled Philip Blenton in the
ante-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What’s your candid opinion of Trevor,
Philip?’ I demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stopped on his way to play bridge, and
bit the end off his cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘As a cricketer,’ he said, ‘or as a man?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Both,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, my candid opinion is that he learned
his game at a first-class public school,’ he replied.
‘And I am further of the opinion, from the few
words I spoke to him, that one would have
expected to find him here and not in the
Sergeants’ Mess. What’s his story? Do you
know?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t,’ I shook my head. ‘Haven’t
an idea. But you’ve confirmed my own impressions.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there I had to leave it for some months.
Periodically I talked to Trevor, deliberately tried
to trap him into some admission which would give
me a clue to his past, but he was as wary as a fox
and as close as an oyster. I don’t know why I
took the trouble—after all, it was his business
entirely, but the fellow intrigued me. He was
such an extraordinarily fine N.C.O., and there
was never a sign of his hitting the bottle, which is
the end of a good many gentlemen-rankers.
Moreover, he didn’t strike me as a fellow who had
come a cropper, which is the usual cause of his
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then one day, when I least expected it,
the problem began to solve itself. Philip
Blenton rang me up in the morning after breakfast,
from a house in the neighbourhood, where
he was staying for a couple of two-day matches.
Could I possibly spare Sergeant Trevor for the
first of them? Against the I Z., who had brought
down a snorting team, and Carter—the Oxford
blue—had failed the local eleven at the last
moment. If I couldn’t they’d have to rake in
one of the gardeners, but they weren’t too strong
as it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I sent for Trevor, and asked him if he’d
care to play. I saw his eyes gleam for a moment;
then he shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think not, thank you, sir,’ he said,
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s not quite like you to let Captain Blenton
down, Trevor,’ I remarked. ‘He’s relying on
you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew it was the right note to take with
him, and I was very keen on his playing. I was
going out myself that afternoon to watch, and I
wanted to see him in different surroundings. We
argued for a bit—I knew he was as keen as
mustard in one way to play—and after a while he
said he would. Then he went out of the office,
and as it happened I followed him. There was
an old cracked mirror in the passage outside,
and as I opened the door he had just shut behind
him, I had a glimpse of Sergeant Trevor examining
his face in the glass. He’d got his hand so
placed that it blotted out his moustache, and he
seemed very intent on his reflection. Then he
saw me, and for a moment or two we stared
at one another in silence. Squadron-leader
and troop-sergeant had gone; we were just two
men, and the passage was empty. And I acted
on a sudden impulse, and clapped him on the
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t be a fool, man,’ I cried. ‘Is
there any reason why you shouldn’t be recognised?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nothing shady, Major,’ he answered,
quietly. ‘But if one starts on a certain course,
it’s best to go through with it!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At that moment the pay-sergeant appeared,
and Trevor pulled himself together, saluted
smartly, and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose these things are planned out beforehand,”
went on the Soldier, thoughtfully. “To
call it all blind chance seems a well-nigh impossible
solution to me. And yet the cynic would
assuredly laugh at connecting a child eating an
orange in a back street in Oxford, and the death
while fishing in Ireland of one of the greatest-hearted
men that ever lived. But unless that
child had eaten that orange, and left the peel on
the pavement for Carter, the Oxford blue, to slip
on and sprain his ankle, the events I am going
to relate would, in all probability, never have
taken place. However, since delving too deeply
into cause and effect inevitably produces insanity,
I’d better get on with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I turned up about three o’clock at Crosby
Hall, along with four or five other fellows from
the regiment. Usual sort of stunt—marquee and
lemonade, with whisky in the background for the
hopeless cases. The I Z. merchants were in the
field, and Trevor was batting. There was an
Eton boy in with him, and the score was two
hundred odd for five wickets. Philip Blenton
lounged up as soon as he saw me, grinning all over
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thank Heaven you let him come, old
man! He’s pulled eighty of the best out of
his bag already, and doesn’t look like getting
out.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He wouldn’t come at first, Philip,’ I said,
and he stared at me in surprise. ‘I think he was
afraid of being recognised.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A burst of applause greeted a magnificent
drive past cover-point, and for a while we watched
the game in silence, until another long round of
cheering announced that Sergeant Trevor had got
his century. As I’ve said before, I’m no
cricketer, but there was no need to be an expert
to realise that he was something out of the way.
He was treating the by-no-means-indifferent I Z.
bowling with the utmost contempt, and old Lord
Apson, our host, was beside himself with joy.
He was a cricket maniac; his week was an annual
fixture; and for the first time for many years he
saw his team really putting it across the I Z. And
it was just as I was basking in a little reflected
glory that I saw a very dear old friend of mine
arrive in the enclosure, accompanied by a perfectly
charming girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, Yeverley, old man!’ I cried, ‘how
are you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dog-face, as I live!’ he shouted, seizing
me by both hands. ‘Man-alive, I’m glad to
see you. Let me introduce you to my wife;
Doris, this is Major Chilham—otherwise Dog-face.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shook hands with the girl, who was standing
smiling beside him, and for a while we stopped
there talking. He was fifteen years or so older
than I, and had left the service as a Captain, but
we both came from the same part of the country,
and in days gone by I’d known him very well
indeed. His marriage had taken place four
years previously while I was abroad, and now,
meeting his wife for the first time, I recalled bit by
bit the gossip I’d heard in letters I got from home.
How to everyone’s amazement he’d married a girl
young enough to be his daughter; how everybody
had prophesied disaster, and affirmed that
she was not half good enough for one of the elect
like Giles Yeverley; how she’d been engaged to
someone else and thrown him over. And yet
as I looked at them both it struck me that the
Jeremiahs had as usual been completely wrong:
certainly nothing could exceed the dog-like
devotion in Giles’s eyes whenever he looked at his
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We strolled over to find some easy chairs,
and he fussed round her as if she was an invalid.
She took it quite naturally and calmly with a
faint and charming smile, and when he finally
bustled away to talk to Apson, leaving me alone
with her, she was still smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You know Giles well?’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Awfully well,’ I answered. ‘And having
now returned from my sojourn in the wilds,
I hope I shall get to know his wife equally
well.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That’s very nice of you, Dog-face’—she
turned and looked at me—and, by Jove, she was
pretty. ‘If you’re anything like Giles—you must
be a perfect dear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I like that sort of a remark when it’s
made in the right way. It establishes a very
pleasant footing at once, with no danger of miconstruction—like
getting on good terms with a
new horse the moment you put your feet in the
irons, instead of messing around for half the
hunt. Anyway, for the next ten minutes or so
I didn’t pay very much attention to the cricket.
I gathered that there was one small son—Giles
junior—who was the apple of his father’s eye;
and that at the moment a heavy love affair was
in progress between the young gentleman aged
three and the General’s daughter, who was as
much as four, and showed no shame over the
matter whatever. Also that Giles and she were
stopping with the General and his wife for a week
or ten days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was at that stage of the proceedings
that a prolonged burst of applause made us look
at the cricket. Sergeant Trevor was apparently
out—how I hadn’t an idea—and was half-way
between the wickets and the tent next to the one
in which we were sitting, and which Apson
always had erected for the local villagers
and their friends. I saw them put up one
hundred and twenty-five on the board as Trevor’s
score, and did my share in the clapping line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A fine player—that fellow,’ I said, following
him with my eyes. ‘Don’t know much about
the game myself, but the experts tell me——’
And at that moment I saw her face, and stopped
abruptly. She had gone very white, and her
knuckles were gleaming like the ivory on the
handle of her parasol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Major Chilham,’ she said—and her voice
was the tensest thing I’ve ever heard—‘who is
that man who has just come out?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Trevor is his name,’ I answered, quietly.
‘He’s one of the troop-sergeants in my squadron.’
I was looking at her curiously, as the colour
slowly came back to her face. ‘Why? Did
you think you knew him?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He reminded me of someone I knew years
ago,’ she said, sitting back in her chair. ‘But
of course I must have been mistaken.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then rather abruptly she changed the
conversation, though every now and then she
glanced towards the next tent, as if trying to see
Trevor. And sitting beside her I realised that
there was something pretty serious in the wind.
She was on edge, though she was trying not to
show it—and Trevor was the cause, or the man
who called himself Trevor. All my curiosity
came back, though I made no allusion to him;
I was content to await further developments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They weren’t long in coming. The house
team, with the respectable total of three hundred
and fifty odd, were all out by tea-time, and both
elevens forgathered in the tent behind. All,
that is, except Trevor, who remained in the other
until Apson himself went and pulled him out. I
watched the old man, with his cheery smile, take
Trevor by the elbow and literally drag him out
of his chair; I watched Trevor in his blue undress
jacket, smart as be damned, coming towards us
with our host. And then very deliberately I
looked at Giles Yeverley’s wife. She was staring
over my head at the two men; then she lowered
her parasol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So you weren’t mistaken after all, Mrs.
Giles,’ I said, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, Dog-face, I wasn’t,’ she answered.
‘Would you get hold of Giles for me, and tell him
I’d like to get back. Say I’m not feeling very
well.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got up at once and went in search of her
husband. I found him talking to the Zingari
captain and Sergeant Trevor. He seemed quite
excited, appealing as he spoke to the I Z. skipper,
while Trevor stood by listening with a faint
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What he says is quite right, Sergeant
Trevor,’ remarked the Zingari man as I came up.
‘If you cared to consider it—you are absolutely
up to the best county form. Of course, I don’t
know about your residential qualifications, but
that can generally be fixed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dog-face,’ cried Yeverley, as soon as he saw
me, ‘he’s in your squadron, isn’t he? Well,
it’s so long since I left the Army that I’ve
forgotten all about discipline—but I tell you
here—right now in front of him—that Sergeant
Trevor ought to chuck soldiering and take up
professional cricket. Bimbo here agrees with
me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Giles, you’ll burst your waistcoat if you
get so excited,’ I remarked, casually. ‘And,
incidentally, Mrs. Yeverley wants to go home.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said the name I looked at Trevor, and
my last doubt vanished. He gave a sudden
start, which Giles, who had immediately torn off
to his wife, didn’t see, and proceeded to back
into the farthest corner of the tea-tent. But once
again old Apson frustrated him. Not for him
the endless pauses and waits of first-class cricket;
five minutes to roll the pitch and he was leading
his team into the field. Trevor had to go from
his sanctuary, and there was only one exit from
the enclosure in front of the tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They met—Mrs. Giles and Trevor—actually
at that exit. By the irony of things, I think
it was Giles who caused the meeting. He hurried
forward as he saw Trevor going out, and caught
him by the arm; dear old chap!—he was cricket
mad if ever a man was. And so blissfully
unconscious of the other, bigger thing going on
right under his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t you forget what I said, Trevor,’ he
said, earnestly. ‘Any county would be glad to
have you. I’m going to talk to Major Chilham
about it seriously.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I doubt if Trevor heard a word. Over
Giles’s shoulder he was staring at Giles’s wife—and
she was staring back at him, while her breast
rose and fell in little gasps, and it seemed to me
that her lips were trembling. Then it was over;
Trevor went out to field—Giles bustled back to his
wife. And I, being a hopeless case, went in
search of alcohol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soldier paused to light another cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He carried out his threat, did Giles with
regard to me. Two or three days later I lunched
with the General, and it seemed to me that we
never got off the subject of Trevor. It wasn’t
only his opinion; had not Bimbo Lawrence, the
I Z. captain, and one of the shrewdest judges of
cricket in England, agreed with him? And so on
without cessation about Trevor, the cricketer,
while on the opposite side of the table, next to
me, sat his wife, who could not get beyond
Trevor, the man. Once or twice she glanced at
me appealingly, as if to say: ‘For God’s sake,
stop him!’—but it was a task beyond my
powers. I made one or two abortive attempts,
and then I gave it up. The situation was beyond
me; one could only let him ramble on and pray
for the end of lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he left the cricket and came to
personalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Know anything about him, Dog-face?’
he asked. ‘Up at old Apson’s place he struck me
as being a gentleman. Anyway, he’s a darned
nice fellow. Wonder why he enlisted?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, Giles, for goodness’ sake, let’s try
another topic?’ said his wife, suddenly. ‘We’ve
had Sergeant Trevor since lunch began.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old Giles looked at her in startled
surprise, and she gave him a quick smile which
robbed her words of their irritability. But I
could see she was on the rack, and though I didn’t
know the real facts, it wasn’t hard to make a
shrewd guess as to the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just before we rose from the table,
I remember, that she said to me under the cover
of the general conversation: ‘My God! Dog-face—it’s
not fair.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you tell me?’ I answered. ‘I might
help.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Perhaps I will some day,’ she said, quietly.
‘But you can’t help; no one can do that. It
was my fault all through, and the only thing
that matters now is that Giles should never
know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know why she suddenly confided
in me, even to that extent. I suppose with
her woman’s intuition she realised that I’d
guessed something, and it helps to get a thing
off one’s chest at times. Evidently it had been
an unexpected meeting, and I cursed myself for
having made him play. And yet how could
one have foretold? It was just a continuation
of the jig-saw started by that damned bit of
orange peel. As she said, all that mattered
was that Giles—dear old chap!—should never
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soldier smiled a little sadly. “So
do the humans propose; but the God that moves
the pieces frequently has different ideas. He
did—that very afternoon. It was just as I was
going that two white-faced nurses clutching two
scared children appeared on the scene and babbled
incoherently. And then the General’s groom
hove in sight—badly cut across the face and
shaky at the knees—and from him we got the
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d started off in the General’s dogcart
to go to some children’s party, and something
had frightened the horse, which had promptly
bolted. I knew the brute—a great raking black,
though the groom, who was a first-class whip,
generally had no difficulty in managing him. But
on this occasion apparently he’d got clean away
along the road into the town. He might have
got the horse under control after a time, when, to
his horror, he saw that the gates were closed at
the railway crossing in front. And it was at that
moment that a man—one of the sergeants from
the barracks—had dashed out suddenly from the
pavement and got to the horse’s head. He was
trampled on badly, but he hung on—and the
horse had ceased to bolt when they crashed into
the gates. The shafts were smashed, but
nothing more. And the horse wasn’t hurt. And
they’d carried away the sergeant on an improvised
stretcher. No; he hadn’t spoken. He was
unconscious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Which sergeant was it?’ I asked, quietly—though
I knew the answer before the groom gave
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sergeant Trevor, sir,’ he said. ‘B
squadron.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is he—is he badly hurt?’ said the girl, and
her face was ashen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I dunno, mum,’ answered the groom.
‘They took ’im off to the ’orspital, and I was
busy with the ’orse.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll ring up, if I may, General,’ I said, and
he nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spoke to Purvis, the R.A.M.C. fellow, and
his voice was very grave. They’d brought Trevor
in still unconscious, and, though he wouldn’t
swear to it at the moment, he was afraid his back
was broken. But he couldn’t tell absolutely
for certain until he came to. I hung up the
receiver and found Mrs. Giles standing behind
me. She said nothing—but just waited for me
to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Purvis doesn’t know for certain,’ I said,
taking both her hands in mine. ‘But there’s a
possibility, my dear, that his back is broken.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a thoroughbred, that girl. She
didn’t make a fuss or cry out; she just looked
me straight in the face and nodded her head once
or twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must go to him, of course,’ she
said, gravely. ‘Will you arrange it for me,
please?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He’s unconscious still,’ I told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then I must be beside him when he comes
to,’ she answered. ‘Even if there was nothing
else—he’s saved my baby’s life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll take you in my car,’ I said, when I
saw that she was absolutely determined. ‘Leave
it all to me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must see him alone, Dog-face.’ She
paused by the door, with her handkerchief
rolled into a tight little ball in her hand. ‘I
want to know that he’s forgiven me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You shall see him alone if it’s humanly
possible,’ I answered gravely, and at that she
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know how I did it, but somehow
or other I got her away from the General’s house
without Giles knowing. Giles junior was quite
unhurt, and disposed to regard the entire thing
as an entertainment got up especially for his
benefit. And when she’d made sure of that, and
kissed him passionately to his intense disgust, she
slipped away with me in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You mustn’t be disappointed,’ I warned
her as we drove along, ‘if you can’t see him alone.
He may have been put into a ward with other
men.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then they must put some screens round him,’
she whispered. ‘I must kiss him before—before——.’
She didn’t complete the sentence;
but it wasn’t necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t speak again until I turned in at
the gates of the hospital. And then I asked her
a question which had been on the tip of my
tongue a dozen times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who is he—really?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jimmy Dallas is his name,’ she answered,
quietly. ‘We were engaged. And then his
father lost all his money. He thought that was
why—why I was beastly to him—but oh!
Dog-face, it wasn’t at all. I thought he was
fond of another girl—and it was all a mistake.
I found it out too late. And then Jimmy had
disappeared—and I’d married Giles. Up at
that cricket match was the first time I’d seen
him since my wedding.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We drew up at the door, and I got out.
It’s the little tragedies, the little misunderstandings,
that are so pitiful, and in all conscience
this was a case in point. A boy and a girl—each
too proud to explain, or ask for an explanation;
and now the big tragedy. God! it seemed
so futile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left her sitting in the car, and went in
search of Purvis. I found him with Trevor—I
still thought of him under that name—and
he was conscious again. The doctor
looked up as I tiptoed in, and shook his head
at me warningly. So I waited, and after a
while Purvis left the bed and drew me out into
the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m not sure,’ he said. ‘He’s so infernally
bruised and messed about. His left arm is
broken in two places, and three ribs—and I’m
afraid his back as well. He seems so numb.
But I can’t be certain.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mrs. Yeverley is here,’ I said. ‘The
mother of one of the kids he saved. She wants
to see him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Out of the question,’ snapped Purvis.
‘I absolutely forbid it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But you mustn’t forbid it, Doctor.’ We
both swung round, to see the girl herself standing
behind us. ‘I’ve got to see him. There are
other reasons besides his having saved my baby’s
life.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They must wait, Mrs. Yeverley,’ answered
the Doctor. ‘In a case of this sort the only
person I would allow to see him would be his
wife.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If I hadn’t been a fool,’ she said deliberately,
‘I should have been his wife,’ and Purvis’s jaw
dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without another word she swept past
him into the ward, and Purvis stood there
gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, I’m damned!’ he muttered, and I
couldn’t help smiling. It was rather a startling
statement to come from a woman stopping
with the G.O.C. about a sergeant in a cavalry
regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, quite suddenly and unexpectedly,
came the final turn in the wheel. I was strolling
up and down outside with Purvis, who was a
sahib as well as a Doctor and had asked no
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If his back is broken it can’t hurt him,’ he
had remarked, ‘and if it isn’t it will do him
good.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At that we had left it, when suddenly, to
my horror, I saw Giles himself going into the
hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good Lord, Doc!’ I cried, sprinting after
him, ‘that’s her husband. And he doesn’t know
she’s here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a lot can happen in a few seconds, and I
was just a few seconds too late. As I got to the
door I saw Giles in front of me—standing at the
entrance to the ward as if he had been turned to
stone. A big screen hid the bed from sight—but
a screen is not sound proof. He looked at me as
I came up, and involuntarily I stopped as I saw
his face. And then quite clearly from the room
beyond came his wife’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My darling, darling boy!—it’s you and only
you for ever and ever!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite know how much Giles had
guessed before. I think he knew about her
previous engagement, but I’m quite sure he had
never associated Trevor with it. A year or two
later she told me that when she married him she
had made no attempt to conceal the fact that she
had loved another man—and loved him still.
And Giles had taken her on those terms. But at
the time I didn’t know that: I only knew that a
very dear friend’s world had crashed about his
head with stunning suddenness. It was Giles
who pulled himself together first—Giles, with a
face grey and lined, who said in a loud voice
to me: ‘Well, Dog-face, where is the invalid?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then he waited a moment or two before
he went round the screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah! my dear,’ he said, quite steadily, as
he saw his wife, ‘you here?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He played his part for ten minutes, stiff-lipped
and without a falter; then he went, and
his wife went with him to continue the play in
which they were billed for life. Trevor’s back
was not broken—in a couple of months he was
back at duty. And so it might have continued
for the duration, but for Giles being drowned
fishing in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soldier stared thoughtfully at the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a first-class fisherman and a wonderful
swimmer, was Giles Yeverley, and sometimes—I
wonder. They say he got caught in a bore—that
perhaps he got cramp. But, as I say,
sometimes—I wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw them—Jimmy Dallas, sometime
Sergeant Trevor, and his wife—at the Ritz two
nights ago. They seemed wonderfully in love,
though they’d been married ten years, and I
stopped by their table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sit down, Dog-face,’ she ordered, ‘and have
a liqueur.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I sat down and had a liqueur. And it
was just as I was going that she looked at me
with her wonderful smile, and said, very softly:
‘Thank God! dear old Giles never knew; and
now, if he does, he’ll understand.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soldier got up and stretched himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big result for a bit of yellow peel.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“I’m</span> not certain, strictly speaking, that my
story can be said to concern my trade,” began the
Writer, after he had seen his guests were comfortable.
“But it happened—this little adventure
of mine—as the direct result of pursuing
my trade, so I will interpret the rule accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My starting-point is the Largest Pumpkin
Ever Produced in Kent. It was the sort of
pumpkin which gets a photograph all to itself
in the illustrated papers—the type of atrocity
which is utterly useless to any human being. And
yet that large and unpleasant vegetable proved
the starting-point of the most exciting episode
in my somewhat prosaic life. In fact, but for
very distinct luck, that pumpkin would have
been responsible for my equally prosaic funeral.’
The Writer smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was years ago, in the days before a misguided
public began to read my books and supply
me with the necessary wherewithal to keep the
wolf from the door. But I was young and full
of hope, and Fleet Street seemed a very wonderful
place. From which you can infer that I was a
journalist, and candour compels me to admit—a
jolly bad one. Not that I realised it at the time.
I regarded my Editor’s complete lack of appreciation
of my merits as being his misfortune, not
my fault. However, I pottered around, doing
odd jobs and having the felicity of seeing my
carefully penned masterpieces completely obscured
by blue pencil and reduced to two
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then one morning I was sent for to the inner
sanctuary. Now, although I had the very lowest
opinion of the Editor’s abilities, I knew sufficient
of the office routine to realise that such a
summons was unlikely to herald a rise of screw
with parchment certificate of appreciation for
services rendered. It was far more likely to
herald the order of the boot—and the prospect
was not very rosy. Even in those days Fleet
Street was full of unemployed journalists who
knew more than their editors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The news editor was in the office when I
walked in, and he was a kindly man, was old
Andrews. He looked at me from under his great
bushy eyebrows for a few moments without
speaking; then he pointed to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Graham,’ he remarked in a deep bass voice,
‘are you aware that this paper has never yet
possessed a man on its staff that writes such
unutterable slush as you do?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remained discreetly silent; to dissent
seemed tactless, to agree, unnecessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you propose to do about it?’
he continued after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him that I hadn’t realised I was as
bad as all that, but that I would do my best to
improve my style and give satisfaction in the
future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s not so much your style,’ he conceded.
‘Years ago I knew a man whose style was worse.
Only a little—but it was worse. But it’s your
nose for news, my boy—that’s the worst thing
that ever came into Fleet Street. Now, what were
you doing yesterday?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I was reporting that wedding at the
Brompton Oratory, sir,’ I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Just so,’ he answered. ‘And are you aware
that in a back street not three hundred yards
from the church a man died through eating a
surfeit of winkles, as the result of a bet? Actually
while you were there did that man die by the
winkle-barrow—and you knew nothing about it.
I’m not denying that your report on the wedding
isn’t fair—but the public is entitled to know
about the dangers of winkle-eating to excess.
Not that the rights of the public matter in the
least, but it’s the principle I want to impress on
you—the necessity of keeping your eyes open for
other things beside the actual job you’re on.
That’s what makes the good journalist.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assured him that I would do so in future,
and he grunted non-committally. Then he began
rummaging in a drawer, while I waited in
trepidation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We’ll give you a bit longer, Graham,’
he announced at length, and I breathed freely
again. ‘But if there is no improvement you’ll
have to go. And in the meantime I’ve got a job
for you this afternoon. Some public-spirited
benefactor has inaugurated an agricultural fête
in Kent, somewhere near Ashford. From what I
can gather, he seems partially wanting in intelligence,
but it takes people all ways. He is giving
prizes for the heaviest potato and the largest egg—though
I am unable to see what the hen’s
activity has to do with her owner. And I want
you to go down and write it up. Half a column.
Get your details right. I believe there is a
treatise on soils and manures in the office
somewhere. And put in a paragraph about
the paramount importance of the Englishman
getting back to the land. Not that it will
have any effect, but it might help to clear
Fleet Street.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was already engrossed in something else,
and dismissed me with a wave of his hand. And
it was just as I got to the door that he called after
me to send Cresswill to him—Cresswill, the star
of all the special men. His reception, I reflected
a little bitterly as I went in search of him, would
be somewhat different from mine. For he had
got to the top of the tree, and was on a really big
job at the time. He did all the criminal work—murder
trials and so forth, and how we youngsters
envied him! Perhaps, in time, one might reach
those dazzling heights, I reflected, as I sat in my
third-class carriage on the way to Ashford. Not
for him mammoth tubers and double-yolkers—but
the things that really counted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got out at Ashford, where I had to change.
My destination was Appledore, and the connection
on was crowded with people obviously bound,
like myself, for the agricultural fête. It was a
part of Kent to which I had never been, and when
I got out at Appledore station I found I was in
the flat Romney Marsh country which stretches
inland from Dungeness. Houses are few and
far between, except in the actual villages themselves—the
whole stretch of land, of course, must
once have been below sea-level—and the actual
fête was being held in a large field on the outskirts
of Appledore. It was about a mile from the
station, and I proceeded to walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day was warm, the road was dusty—and
I, I am bound to admit, was bored. I felt
I was destined for better things than reporting
on bucolic flower shows, much though I loved
flowers. But I like them in their proper place,
growing—not arranged for show in a stuffy tent
and surrounded by perspiring humanity. And so
when I came to the gates of a biggish house and
saw behind them a garden which was a perfect
riot of colour, involuntarily I paused and looked
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The house itself stood back about a hundred
yards from the road—a charming old place
covered with creepers, and the garden was lovely.
A little neglected, perhaps—I could see a respectable
number of weeds in a bed of irises close to the
drive—but then it was quite a large garden.
Probably belonged to some family that could not
afford a big staff, I reflected, and that moment
I saw a man staring at me from between some
shrubs a few yards away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no reason why he shouldn’t
stare at me—he was inside the gate and presumably
had more right to the garden than I
had—but there was something about him that
made me return the stare, in silence, for a few
moments. Whether it was his silent approach
over the grass and unexpected appearance, or
whether it was that instinctively he struck me as
an incongruous type of individual to find in such
a sleepy locality, I can’t say. Or, perhaps, it
was a sudden lightning impression of hostile
suspicion on his part, as if he resented anyone
daring to look over his gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he came towards me, and I felt I had
to say something. But even as I spoke the
thought flashed across my mind that he would
have appeared far more at home in a London bar
than in a rambling Appledore garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I was admiring your flowers,’ I said as he
came up. ‘Your irises are wonderful.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looked vaguely at some lupins, then his
intent gaze came back to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The garden is well known locally,’ he remarked.
‘Are you a member of these parts?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ I answered, ‘I come from London,’
and it seemed to me his gaze grew more intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am only a bird of passage, too,’ he said
easily. ‘Are you just down for the day?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I informed him that I had come down to
write up the local fête; being young and foolish,
I rather think I implied that only the earnest
request of the organiser for me in particular had
persuaded the editor to dispense with my
invaluable services even for a few hours. And all
the time his eyes, black and inscrutable, never
left my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The show is being held in a field about a
quarter of a mile farther on,’ he said when I
had finished. ‘Good morning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned abruptly on his heels and walked
slowly away towards the house, leaving me a little
annoyed, and with a feeling that not only had I
been snubbed, but, worse still, had been seen
through. I felt that I had failed to convince
him that editors tore their hair and bit their nails
when they failed to secure my services; I felt,
indeed, just that particular type of ass that one
does feel when one has boasted vaingloriously,
and been listened to with faintly amused
boredom. I know that as I resumed my walk
towards the agricultural fête I endeavoured to
restore my self-respect by remembering that he
was merely a glorified yokel, who probably knew
no better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Writer leant back in his chair with a faint
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That awful show still lives in my memory,”
he continued after a while. “There were swing
boats, and one of those ghastly shows where
horses go round and round with a seasick motion
and ‘The Blue Bells of Scotland’ emerges without
cessation from the bowels of the machine.
There were coco-nut shies and people peering
through horse-collars to have their photographs
taken, and over everything an all-pervading
aroma of humanity unsuitably clad in its Sunday
best on a warm day. However, the job had to be
done, so I bravely plunged into the marquees
devoted to the competing vegetables. I listened
to the experts talking around me with the idea of
getting the correct local colour, but as most of
their remarks were incomprehensible, I soon gave
that up as a bad job and began looking about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were potatoes and carrots and a lot of
things which I may have eaten, but completely
failed to recognise in a raw state. And then
suddenly, through a gap in the asparagus, I saw
a vast yellowy-green object. It seemed about
four times the size of an ordinary Rugby football,
and a steady stream of people circled slowly
round it and an ancient man, who periodically
groomed it with a vast coloured handkerchief. So
I steered a zigzag course between a watery-eyed
duck on my right and a hand-holding couple on
my left, and joined the stream. At close quarters
it seemed even vaster than when viewed from the
other side of the tent, and after I’d made the
grand tour twice, I thought I’d engage the ancient
man in conversation. Unfortunately, he was
stone deaf, and his speech was a little indistinct
owing to a regrettable absence of teeth, so we
managed between us to rivet the fascinated attention
of every human being in the tent. In
return for the information that it was the largest
pumpkin ever produced in Kent, I volunteered
that I had come from London specially to write
about it. He seemed a bit hazy about London,
but when I told him it was larger than Appledore
he appeared fairly satisfied that his pumpkin
would obtain justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He also launched into a voluble discourse,
which was robbed of much of its usefulness by
his habit of holding his false teeth in position with
his thumb as he spoke. Luckily a local interpreter
was at hand, and from him I gathered that
the old man was eighty-five, and had never been
farther afield than Ashford, forty-eight years
ago. Also that he was still gardener at Cedarlime,
a house which I must have passed on my
way from the station. Standing well back it
was: fine flower gardens—‘but not what they
was. Not since the new gentleman come—a
year ago. Didn’t take the same interest—not
him. A scholard, they said ’e was; crates and
crates of books had come to the house—things
that ’eavy that they took three and four men to
lift them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He rambled on did that interpreter, while the
ancient man polished the pumpkin in the time-honoured
manner, and wheezed spasmodically.
But I wasn’t paying much attention, because it
had suddenly come back to me that Cedarlime
was the name of the house where I had spoken to
the inscrutable stranger. Subconsciously I had
noticed it as I crossed the road; now it was
brought back to my memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is the owner of Cedarlime a youngish, man?’
I asked my informant. ‘Dark hair; rather
sallow face?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shook his head. The owner of Cedarlime
was a middle-aged man with grey hair, but he
often had friends stopping with him who came
from London, so he’d heard tell—friends who didn’t
stop long—just for the week-end, maybe, or four
or five days. Probably the man I meant was
one of these friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My informant passed on to inspect a red and
hairy gooseberry, and I wandered slowly out of
the stuffy tent. Probably a friend—in fact,
undoubtedly a friend. But try as I would to
concentrate on that confounded flower show, my
thoughts kept harking back to Cedarlime. For
some reason or other, that quiet house and the
man who had come so silently out of the bushes
had raised my curiosity. And at that moment
I narrowly escaped death from a swing boat,
which brought me back to the business in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it was about three hours later
that I started to stroll back to the station. I
was aiming at a five o’clock train, and intended to
write my stuff on the way up to Town. But just
as I was getting to the gates of the house that
interested me, who should I see in front of me
but the venerable pumpkin polisher. He turned
as I got abreast of him and recognised me with
a throaty chuckle. And he promptly started to
talk. I gathered that he had many other priceless
treasures in his garden—wonderful sweet-peas,
more pumpkins of colossal dimensions. And after
a while I further gathered that he was suggesting
I should go in and examine them for myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment I hesitated. I looked at my
watch—there was plenty of time. Then I looked
over the gates and made up my mind. I would
introduce this ancient being into my account of
the fête; write up, in his own setting, this
extraordinary old man who had never left
Appledore for forty-eight years. And, in addition,
I would have a closer look at the house—possibly
even see the scholarly owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I glanced curiously round as I followed him
up the drive. We went about half-way to the
house, then turned off along a path into the
kitchen garden. And finally he came to rest in
front of the pumpkins—he was obviously a
pumpkin maniac. I should think he conducted
a monologue for five minutes on the habits of
pumpkins while I looked about me. Occasionally
I said ‘Yes’; occasionally I nodded my
head portentously; for the rest of the time I paid
no attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could see half the front and one side of the
house—but there seemed no trace of any
occupants. And I was just going to ask the old
man who lived there, when I saw a man in his
shirt-sleeves standing at one of the windows.
He was not the man who had spoken to me at the
gate; he was not a grey-headed man either, so
presumably not the owner. He appeared to be
engrossed in something he was holding in his
hands, and after a while he held it up to the
light in the same way one holds up a photographic
plate. It was then that he saw me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I have never been an imaginative
person, but there was something positively uncanny
in the way that man disappeared.
Literally in a flash he had gone and the window
was empty. And my imagination began to stir.
Why had that man vanished so instantaneously
at the sight of a stranger in the kitchen garden?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then another thing began to strike me.
Something which had been happening a moment
or two before had abruptly stopped—a noise,
faint and droning, but so steady that I hadn’t
noticed it until it ceased. It had been the sort
of noise which, if you heard it to-day, you would
say was caused by an aeroplane a great way
off—and quite suddenly it had stopped. A
second or two after the man had seen me and
vanished from the window, that faint droning
noise had ceased. I was sure of it, and my
imagination began to stir still more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, by this time my venerable guide
had exhausted pumpkins, and, muttering strange
words, he began to lead me towards another part
of the garden. It was sweet-peas this time, and
I must say they were really magnificent. In
fact, I had forgotten the disappearing gentleman
at the window in my genuine admiration of the
flowers, when I suddenly saw the old man
straighten himself up, take a firm grip of his false
teeth with his one hand and touch his cap with
the other. He was looking over my shoulder, and
I swung round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three men were standing behind me on the
path. One was the man I had spoken to that
morning; one was the man I had seen at the
window; the other was grey-haired, and, I
assumed, the owner of the house. It was to him
I addressed myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must apologise for trespassing,’ I began,
‘but I am reporting the agricultural fête down
here, and your gardener asked me in to see
your sweet-peas. They are really magnificent
specimens.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The elderly man stared at me in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t quite see what the sweet-peas in
my garden have to do with the fête,’ he remarked
coldly. ‘And it is not generally customary, when
the owner is at home, to wander round his garden
at the invitation of his gardener.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then I can only apologise and withdraw
at once,’ I answered stiffly. ‘I trust that I have
not irreparably damaged your paths.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He frowned angrily and seemed on the point
of saying something, when the man I had spoken
to at the gate took his arm and whispered something
in his ear. I don’t know what it was he
said, but it had the effect of restoring the grey-haired
man to a better temper at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must apologise,’ he said affably, ‘for my
brusqueness. I am a recluse, Mr.—ah—Mr.——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Graham is my name,’ I answered, partially
mollified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He bowed. ‘A recluse, Mr. Graham—and
my garden is a hobby of mine. That and my
books. I fear I may have seemed a little irritable
when I first spoke, but I have a special system
of my own for growing sweet-peas, and I guard it
jealously. I confess that for a moment I was
unjust and suspicious enough to think you might
be trying to pump information from my
gardener.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked at old Methuselah, still clutching his
false teeth, and smiled involuntarily. The
elderly man guessed my thoughts and smiled,
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am apt to forget that it takes several
months to interpret old Jake,’ he continued.
‘Those false teeth of his fascinate one, don’t
they? I shall never forget the dreadful occasion
he dropped them in the hot bed. We had the
most agonising search, and finally persistence
triumphed. They were rescued unscathed and
restored to their rightful place.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so he went on talking easily, until half-unconsciously
I found myself strolling with him
towards the house. Every now and then he
stopped to point out some specimen of which he
was proud, and, without my realising it, twenty
minutes or so slipped by. It was the sound of a
whistle at the station that recalled me to the
passage of time, and I hurriedly looked at my
watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good Heavens!’ I cried, ‘I’ve missed my
train. When is the next?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The next, Mr. Graham. I’m afraid there
isn’t a next till to-morrow morning. This is a
branch line, you know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jove! how I swore inwardly. After what
old Andrews had said to me only that morning,
to go and fail again would finally cook my goose.
You must remember that it was before the days of
motor-cars, and, with the fête in progress, the
chance of getting a cart to drive me some twelve
miles to Ashford was remote—anyway for the
fare I could afford to pay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose my agitation showed on my face,
for the grey-haired man became quite upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How stupid of me not to have thought of
the time,’ he cried. ‘We must think of the best
thing to do. I know,’ he said suddenly—‘you
must telegraph your report. Stop the night here
and telegraph.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pointed out to him rather miserably that
newspapers did not like the expense of wiring
news unless it was important, and that by no
stretch of imagination could the Appledore
Flower Show be regarded as coming under that
category.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I will pay the cost,’ he insisted, and waved
aside my refusal. ‘Mr. Graham,’ he said, ‘it
was my fault. I am a wealthy man; I would
not dream of letting you suffer for my verbosity.
You will wire your article, and I shall pay.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Writer smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What could have been more charming,”
he continued—“what more considerate and
courteous? My stupid, half-formed suspicions,
which had been growing fainter and fainter as I
strolled round the garden with my host, had by
this time vanished completely, and when he
found me pens, ink, and paper, as they say in the
French exercise book, I stammered out my
thanks. He cut me short with a smile, and told
me to get on with my article. He would send it
to the telegraph office, and tell his servants to get
a room ready for me. And with another smile
he left me alone, and I saw him pottering about
the garden outside as I wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether it has ever happened
to any of you fellows”—the Writer lit a cigarette—“to
harbour suspicions which are gradually
lulled, only to have them suddenly return with
redoubled force. There was I, peacefully writing
my account of the Appledore fête, while outside
my host, an enthusiastic gardener, as he had told
me, pursued his hobby. Could anything have
been more commonplace and matter of fact?
He was engaged on the roses at the moment,
spraying them with some solution, presumably
for green fly, and unconsciously I watched him.
No, I reflected, it couldn’t be for green fly,
because he was only spraying the roots, and even
I, though not an expert, knew that green fly
occur round the buds. And at that moment I
caught a momentary glimpse of the two other
men. They were roaring with laughter, and it
seemed to me that my host was the cause of the
merriment. He looked up and saw them, and the
hilarity ceased abruptly. The next moment
they had disappeared, and my host was continuing
the spraying. He went on industriously for
a few minutes, then he crossed the lawn towards
the open window of the room where I was writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nearly finished?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very nearly,’ I answered. ‘Green fly bad
this year?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Green fly?’ he said a little vaguely.
‘Oh! so-so.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I thought you must be tackling them on the
roses,’ I pursued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Er, quite—quite,’ he remarked. ‘Nasty
things, aren’t they?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is it a special system of yours to go for the
roots?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He gave me one searching look, then he
laughed mysteriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah, ha! my young friend,’ he answered.
‘Don’t you try and get my stable secrets out of
me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I felt he was lying. Without thinking
something made me draw a bow at a venture, and
the arrow went home with a vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Wonderful delphiniums you’ve got,’ I
remarked, leaning out of the window and
pointing to a bed underneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of those.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the flowers at which I was pointing were
irises. So this enthusiastic gardener did not
know the difference between a delphinium and an
iris. Back in an overwhelming wave came all
my suspicions; I knew there was a mystery
somewhere. This man wasn’t a gardener; and,
if not, why this pretence? I remember now that
every time he had drawn my attention to a
specimen he had taken the attached label in his
hand. Quite unobtrusive it had been, unnoticeable
at the time, now it suddenly became significant.
Why was he playing this part—pretending
for my benefit? Futilely spraying the roots of
roses, making me miss my train. I was convinced
now that that had been part of the plan—but
why? Why the telegraphing? Why the
invitation to stop the night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old brain was working pretty quickly by
this time. No one, whatever his business, would
object to a <span class='it'>bona fide</span> journalist writing an account
of a fête, and if the business were crooked, the
people engaged on it would be the first to speed
that journalist on his way. People of that type
dislike journalists only one degree less than the
police. Then why—why? The answer simply
stuck out—they suspected me of not being a
journalist, or, even if they did not go as far
as that, they were taking no chances on the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, I was by this time definitely convinced
in my own mind that I had quite
unwittingly stumbled into a bunch of criminals,
and it struck me that the sooner I stumbled out
again the better for my health. So I put my
article in my pocket and went to the door. I
would wire it off, and I would not return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first hitch occurred at the door, which
had thoughtfully been locked. Not being a hero
of fiction, I confess it gave me a nasty shock—that
unyielding door. And as I stood there
taking a pull at myself I heard the grey-haired
man’s voice outside the window:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Finished yet, Mr. Graham?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I walked across the room, and in as steady
a voice as I could muster I mentioned the fact
that the door was locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So that you shouldn’t be disturbed, Mr.
Graham’—and I thought of the Wolf in ‘Red
Riding Hood,’ with his satisfactory answers to all
awkward questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If someone would open it, I’ll get along to
the telegraph office,’ I remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I wouldn’t dream of your going to so much
trouble,’ he said suavely. ‘I’ve a lazy boy I
employ in the garden; he’ll take it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment I hesitated, and a glint came
into his eyes, which warned me to be careful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was then that I had my brainstorm. If
I hadn’t had it I shouldn’t be here now; if the
powers that be in the newspaper world were not
the quickest people on the uptake you can meet
in a day’s march, I shouldn’t be here now either.
But like a flash of light there came to my mind
the story I had once been told of how a war
correspondent in the South African War, at a time
when they were tightening the censorship, got
back full news of a battle by alluding to the rise
and fall of certain stock. And the editor in
England read between the lines—substituted
troops for stocks, Canadians for C.P.R., and so
on—and published the only account of the
battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I do the same? I hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh! there’s one thing I’ve forgotten,’ I
remarked. ‘I’ll just add it if the boy can
wait.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I sat down at the table, and to my report
I added the following sentences:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There was also some excellent mustard and
cress. Will come at once, but fear to-morrow
morning may be too late for me to be of further
use over Ronaldshay affair.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I handed it to the grey-haired man
through the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Writer leant back in his chair, and the
Soldier stared at him, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bit too cryptic for me,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God! it wasn’t too cryptic for the
office,” said the Writer. “There was no Ronaldshay
affair, so I knew that would draw their
attention. And perhaps you’ve forgotten the
name of our star reporter, who dealt in criminal
matters. It was Cresswill. And if you write
the word cress with a capital C and leave out the
full stop after it, you’ll see the message I got
through to the office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s uncommon lucky for you his name
wasn’t Snooks,” remarked the Actor with a grin.
“What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we had dinner, and I can only suppose
that my attempts to appear at ease had failed to
convince my companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last thing I remember that night was
drinking a cup of coffee—the old trick—and
suddenly realising it was drugged. I staggered
to my feet, while they remained sitting round the
table watching me. Then, with a final glimpse
of the grey-haired man’s face, I passed into
oblivion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I came to I was in a strange room,
feeling infernally sick. And I shall never forget
my wild relief when the man by the window
turned round and I saw it was Cresswill himself.
He came over to the bed and smiled down
at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well done, youngster,’ he said, and a glow
of pride temporarily replaced my desire for a
basin. ‘Well done, indeed. We’ve got the
whole gang, and we’ve been looking for ’em for
months. They were bank-note forgers on a big
scale, but we were only just in time to save you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How was that?’ I asked weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think they had decided that your sphere
of usefulness was over,’ he remarked with a grin.
‘So after having removed suspicion by telegraphing
your report, they gave you a very good
dinner, when, as has been known to happen with
young men before, you got very drunk.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I was drugged,’ I said indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The point is immaterial,’ he answered
quietly. ‘Drunk or drugged, it’s much the same
after you’ve been run over by a train. And we
found two of them carrying you along a lane
towards the line at half-past eleven. The down
goods to Hastings passes at twenty to twelve.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at that moment Providence was kind.
I ceased to <span class='it'>feel</span> sick. I was.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>I don’t</span> pretend to account for it; I am
merely giving the plain unvarnished tale of what
took place to my certain knowledge at Jack
Drage’s house in Kent during the week-end which
finished so disastrously. Doubtless there is an
explanation: maybe there are several. The
believers in spiritualism and things psychic
will probably say that the tragedy was due to the
action of a powerful influence which had remained
intact throughout the centuries; the materialists
will probably say it was due to indigestion. I
hold no brief for either side: as the mere
narrator, the facts are good enough for me. And,
anyway, the extremists of both schools of thought
are quite irreconcilable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were six of us there, counting Jack
Drage and his wife. Bill Sibton in the Indian
Civil, Armytage in the Gunners, and I—Staunton
by name, and a scribbler of sorts—were the men:
little Joan Neilson—Armytage’s fiancée—supported
Phyllis Drage. Ostensibly we were there
to shoot a few pheasants, but it was more than a
mere shooting party. It was a reunion after
long years of us four men who had been known at
school as the Inseparables. Bill had been in
India for twelve years, save for the inevitable gap
in Mesopotamia; Dick Armytage had soldiered
all over the place ever since he’d left the Shop.
And though I’d seen Jack off and on since our
school-days, I’d lost touch with him since he’d
married. Wives play the deuce with bachelor
friends though they indignantly deny it—God
bless ’em. At least, mine always does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time any of us had been inside
Jack’s house, and undoubtedly he had the most
delightful little property. The house itself was
old, but comfortably modernised by an expert,
so that the charm of it still remained. In fact,
the only room which had been left absolutely
intact was the dining-room. And to have
touched that would have been sheer vandalism.
The sole thing that had been done to it was to
install central heating, and that had been carried
out so skilfully that no trace of the work could
be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a room by itself, standing apart from the
rest of the house, with a lofty vaulted roof in
which one could just see the smoky old oak
beams by the light of the candles on the dinner-table.
A huge open fireplace jutted out from one
of the longer walls; while on the opposite side a
door led into the garden. And then, at one end,
approached by the original staircase at least six
centuries old, was the musicians’ gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wonderful room—a room in which it seemed
almost sacrilege to eat and smoke and discuss
present-day affairs—a room in which one felt
that history had been made. Nothing softened
the severe plainness of the walls save a few
mediæval pikes and battleaxes. In fact, two old
muskets of the Waterloo era were the most
modern implements of the collection. Of pictures
there was only one—a very fine painting of a man
dressed in the fashion of the Tudor period—which
hung facing the musicians’ gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was that that caught my eye as we sat down
to dinner, and I turned to Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An early Drage?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a matter of fact—no relation at all,” he
answered. “But a strong relation to this
room. That’s why I hang him there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any story attached thereto?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is; though I can’t really do it justice.
The parson here is the only man who knows the
whole yarn.—By the way, old dear,” he spoke
to his wife across the table, “the reverend bird
takes tea with us to-morrow. But he is the only
man who has the thing at his finger tips. The
previous owner was a bit vague himself, but
having a sense of the fitness of things, he gave me
a chance of buying the picture. Apparently it’s
a painting of one Sir James Wrothley who lived
round about the time of Henry VIII. He was
either a rabid Protestant or a rabid Roman
Catholic—I told you I was a bit vague over
details—and he used this identical room as a
secret meeting-place for himself and his pals to
hatch plots against his enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack <span class='it'>is</span> so illuminating, isn’t he?” laughed
his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I bet you can’t tell it any better yourself,”
he retorted with a grin. “I admit my history
is weak. But anyway, about that time, if
the jolly old Protestants weren’t burning the
R.C.’s, the R.C.’s were burning the Protestants.
A period calling for great tact, I’ve always
thought. Well, at any rate, this Sir James
Wrothley—when his party was being officially
burned—came here and hatched dark schemes to
reverse the procedure. And then, apparently,
one day somebody blew the gaff, and the whole
bunch of conspirators in here were absolutely
caught in the act by the other crowd, who put
’em all to death on the spot. Which is all I can
tell you about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must ask the padre to-morrow,” I said
to his wife. “I’d rather like to hear the whole
story. I felt when I first came into this room
there was history connected with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me rather strangely for a
moment; then she gave a little forced laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Tom,” she said slowly, “at
times I almost hate this room. All my friends
gnash their teeth with envy over it—but sometimes,
when Jack’s been away, and I’ve dined in
here by myself—it’s terrified me. I feel as if—I
wasn’t alone: as if—there were people all
round me—watching me. Of course, it’s absurd,
I know. But I can’t help it. And yet I’m not a
nervy sort of person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it’s at all absurd,” I assured
her. “I believe I should feel the same myself.
A room of this size, which, of necessity, is dimly
lighted in the corners, and which is full of
historical associations, must cause an impression
on the least imaginative person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We used it once for a dance,” she laughed;
“with a ragtime band in the gallery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a great show it was, too,” broke in her
husband. “The trouble was that one of the
musicians got gay with a bottle of whisky, and
very nearly fell clean through that balustrade
effect on to the floor below. I haven’t had that
touched—and the wood is rotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pray you be seated, gentlemen.” A sudden
silence fell on the table, and everybody stared at
Bill Sibton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a game, Bill?” asked Jack Drage.
“I rather thought we were. And what about the
ladies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a puzzled frown Bill Sibton looked at him.
“Did I speak out loud, then?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so early in the evening too!” Joan
Neilson laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must have been day-dreaming, I suppose.
But that yarn of yours has rather got me, Jack;
though in the course of a long and evil career
I’ve never heard one told worse. I was thinking
of that meeting—all of them sitting here. And
then suddenly that door bursting open.” He was
staring fixedly at the door, and again a silence fell
on us all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thunder of the butts of their muskets on
the woodwork.” He swung round and faced the
door leading to the garden. “And on that one,
too. Can’t you hear them? No escape—none.
Caught like rats in a trap.” His voice died away
to a whisper, and Joan Neilson gave a little
nervous laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the most realistic person, Mr. Sibton.
I think I prefer hearing about the dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I glanced at my hostess—and it seemed to me
that there was fear in her eyes as she looked at
Bill. Sometimes now I wonder if she had some
vague premonition of impending disaster: something
too intangible to take hold of—something
the more terrifying on that very account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after dinner that Jack Drage switched
on the solitary electric light of which the room
boasted. It was so placed as to show up the
painting of Sir James Wrothley, and in silence
we all gathered round to look at it. A pair of
piercing eyes set in a stern aquiline face stared
down at us from under the brim of a hat adorned
with sweeping plumes; his hand rested on the
jewelled hilt of his sword. It was a fine picture
in a splendid state of preservation, well worthy
of its place of honour on the walls of such a room,
and we joined in a general chorus of admiration.
Only Bill Sibton was silent, and he seemed fascinated—unable
to tear his eyes away from the
painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a matter of fact, Bill,” said Dick Armytage,
studying the portrait critically, “he might
well be an ancestor of yours. Wash out your
moustache, and give you a fancy-dress hat, and
you’d look very much like the old bean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was quite right: there was a distinct
resemblance, and it rather surprised me that I
had not noticed it myself. There were the same
deep-set piercing eyes, the same strong, slightly
hatchet face, the same broad forehead. Even
the colouring was similar: a mere coincidence
that, probably—but one which increased the
likeness. In fact, the longer I looked the more
pronounced did the resemblance become, till it
was almost uncanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he can’t be, anyway,” said Bill
abruptly. “I’ve never heard of any Wrothley
in the family.” He looked away from the
picture almost with an effort and lit a cigarette.
“It’s a most extraordinary thing, Jack,” he
went on after a moment, “but ever since we
came into this room I’ve had a feeling that I’ve
been here before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, man, that’s common enough in
all conscience. One often gets that idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know one does,” answered Bill. “I’ve had
it before myself; but never one-tenth as strongly
as I feel it here. Besides, that feeling generally
dies—after a few minutes: it’s growing stronger
and stronger with me every moment I stop in
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let’s go into the drawing-room,” said
our hostess. “I’ve had the card-table put in
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed her and Joan Neilson into the
main part of the house; and since neither of the
ladies played, for the next two hours we four
men bridged. And then, seeing that it was a
special occasion, we sat yarning over half-forgotten
incidents till the room grew thick with
smoke and the two women fled to bed before
they died of asphyxiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill, I remember, waxed eloquent on the
subject of politicians, with a six weeks’ experience
of India, butting in on things they knew less
than nothing about; Dick Armytage grew melancholy
on the subject of the block in promotion.
And then the reminiscences grew more personal,
and the whisky sank lower and lower in the
tantalus as one yarn succeeded another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Jack Drage rose with a yawn and
knocked the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two o’clock, boys. What about bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! is it really?” Dick Armytage
stretched himself. “However, no shooting to-morrow,
or, rather, to-day. We might spend
the Sabbath dressing Bill up as his nibs in the
next room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow crossed Bill’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d forgotten that room,” he said, frowning.
“Damn you, Dick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear old boy,” laughed Armytage, “you
surely don’t mind resembling the worthy Sir
James! He’s a deuced sight better-looking
fellow than you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill shook his head irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that at all,” he said. “I wasn’t
thinking of the picture.” He seemed to be on
the point of saying something else—then he
changed his mind. “Well—bed for master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all trooped upstairs, and Jack came round
to each of us to see that we were all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breakfast provisionally nine,” he remarked.
“Night-night, old boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door closed behind him, and his steps
died away down the passage as he went to his
own room.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:2em;'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</p>

<p class='pindent'>By all known rules I should have been asleep
almost as my head touched the pillow. A day’s
rough shooting, followed by bed at two in the
morning should produce that result if anything
can, but in my case that night it didn’t. Whether
I had smoked too much, or what it was, I know
not, but at half-past three I gave up the attempt
and switched on my light. Then I went over,
and pulling up an armchair, I sat down by the
open window. There was no moon, and the
night was warm for the time of year. Outlined
against the sky the big dining-room stretched
out from the house, and, as I lit a cigarette,
Jack Drage’s vague story returned to my mind.
The conspirators, meeting by stealth to hatch
some sinister plot; the sudden alarm as they
found themselves surrounded; the desperate
fight against overwhelming odds—and then, the
end. There should be a story in it, I reflected;
I’d get the parson to tell me the whole thing
accurately next day. The local colour seemed
more appropriate when one looked at the room
from the outside, with an occasional cloud
scudding by over the big trees beyond. Savoured
more of conspiracy and death than when dining
inside, with reminiscences of a jazz band in the
musicians’ gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that moment a dim light suddenly
filtered out through the windows. It was so dim
that at first I thought I had imagined it; so dim
that I switched off my own light in order to make
sure. There was no doubt about it: faint but
unmistakable the reflection showed up on the
ground outside. A light had been lit in the old
dining-room: therefore someone must be in
there. At four o’clock in the morning!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two I hesitated: should I go
along and rouse Jack? Someone might have
got in through the garden door, and I failed to
see why I should fight another man’s burglar in
his own house. And then it struck me it would
only alarm his wife—I’d get Bill, whose room was
opposite mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I put on some slippers and crossed the landing
to rouse him. And then I stopped abruptly.
His door was open; his room was empty.
Surely it couldn’t be he who had turned on the
light below?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As noiselessly as possible I went downstairs,
and turned along the passage to the dining-room.
Sure enough the door into the main part of the
house was ajar, and the light was shining
through the opening. I tiptoed up to it and
looked through the crack by the hinges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first I could see nothing save the solitary
electric light over the portrait of Sir James. And
then in the gloom beyond I saw a tall figure
standing motionless by the old oak dining-table.
It was Bill—even in the dim light I recognised
that clean-cut profile; Bill clad in his pyjamas
only, with one hand stretched out in front of
him, pointing. And then, suddenly, he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie, Sir Henry!—you lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing more—just that one remark; his
hand still pointing inexorably across the table.
Then after a moment he turned so that the light
fell full on his face, and I realised what was the
matter. Bill Sibton was walking in his sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he came towards the door behind which
I stood, and passed through it—so close that he
almost touched me as I shrank back against the
wall. Then he went up the stairs, and as soon
as I heard him reach the landing above, I quickly
turned out the light in the dining-room and
followed him. His bedroom door was closed:
there was no sound from inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing more for me to do: my
burglar had developed into a harmless somnambulist.
Moreover, it suddenly struck me that I
had become most infernally sleepy myself. So
I did not curse Bill mentally as much as I might
have done. I turned in, and my nine o’clock
next morning was very provisional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So was Bill Sibton’s: we arrived together for
breakfast at a quarter to ten. He looked
haggard and ill, like a man who has not slept, and
his first remark was to curse Dick Armytage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had the most infernal dreams last night,”
he grumbled. “Entirely through Dick reminding
me of this room. I dreamed the whole show
that took place in here in that old bird’s time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to the portrait of Sir James.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you!” I remarked, pouring out some
coffee. “Must have been quite interesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I wasn’t at all popular with the
crowd,” he said. “I don’t set any store by
dreams myself—but last night it was really extraordinarily
vivid.” He stirred his tea thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can quite imagine that, Bill. Do you ever
walk in your sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk in my sleep? No.” He stared at me
surprised. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did last night. I found you down here
at four o’clock in your pyjamas. You were
standing just where I’m sitting now, pointing
with your hand across the table. And as I
stood outside the door you suddenly said, ‘You
lie, Sir Henry!—you lie!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Part of my dream,” he muttered. “Sir
Henry Brayton was the name of the man—and
he was the leader. They were all furious with
me about something. We quarrelled—and after
that there seemed to be a closed door. It was
opening slowly, and instinctively I knew there
was something dreadful behind it. You know
the terror of a dream; the primordial terror of
the mind that cannot reason against something
hideous—unknown——” I glanced at him: his
forehead was wet with sweat. “And then the
dream passed. The door didn’t open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly, my lad,” I remarked lightly,
“you had one whisky too many last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be an ass, Tom,” he said irritably.
“I tell you—though you needn’t repeat it—I’m
in a putrid funk of this room. Absurd, I know:
ridiculous. But I can’t help it. And if there
was a train on this branch line on Sunday, I’d
leave to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good Lord, Bill,” I began—and then
I went on with my breakfast. There was a look
on his face which it is not good to see on the
face of a man. It was terror: an abject, dreadful
terror.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>He and Jack Drage were out for a long walk
when the parson came to tea that afternoon—a
walk of which Bill had been the instigator. He
had dragged Jack forth, vigorously protesting,
after lunch, and we had cheered them on their
way. Bill had to get out of the house—I could
see that. Then Dick and the girl had disappeared,
in the way that people in their condition
<span class='it'>do</span> disappear, just before Mr. Williams
arrived. And so only Phyllis Drage was there,
presiding at the tea-table, when I broached the
subject of the history of the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He spoils paper, Mr. Williams,” laughed my
hostess, “and he scents copy. Jack tried to
tell the story last night, and got it hopelessly
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clergyman smiled gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to alter the setting, Mr. Staunton,”
he remarked, “because the story is quite
well known round here. In my library at the
vicarage I have an old manuscript copy of the
legend. And indeed, I have no reason to believe
that it is a legend: certainly the main points
have been historically authenticated. Sir James
Wrothley, whose portrait hangs in the dining-room,
lived in this house. He was a staunch
Protestant—bigoted to a degree; and he fell
very foul of Cardinal Wolsey, who you may
remember was plotting for the Papacy at the
time. So bitter did the animosity become,
and so high did religious intoleration run in
those days, that Sir James started counter-plotting
against the Cardinal; which was a
dangerous thing to do. Moreover, he and his
friends used the dining-room here as their
meeting-place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reverend gentleman sipped his tea; if
there was one thing he loved it was the telling
of this story, which reflected so magnificently on
the staunch no-Popery record of his parish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much is historical certainty; the rest is
not so indisputably authentic. The times of the
meetings were, of course, kept secret—until the
fatal night occurred. Then, apparently, someone
turned traitor. And, why I cannot tell you,
Sir James himself was accused by the others—especially
Sir Henry Brayton. Did you say
anything, Mr. Staunton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” I remarked quietly. “The name
surprised me for a moment. Please go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Henry Brayton was Sir James’s next-door
neighbour, almost equally intolerant of
anything savouring of Rome. And even while,
so the story goes, Wolsey’s men were hammering
on the doors, he and Sir Henry had this dreadful
quarrel. Why Sir James should have been
suspected, whether the suspicions were justified
or not I cannot say. Certainly, in view of what
we know of Sir James’s character, it seems hard
to believe that he could have been guilty of such
infamous treachery. But that the case must
have appeared exceedingly black against him is
certain from the last and most tragic part of
the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again Mr. Williams paused to sip his
tea; he had now reached that point of the
narrative where royalty itself would have failed
to hurry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In those days, Mrs. Drage, there was a door
leading into the musicians’ gallery from one of
the rooms of the house. It provided no avenue
of escape if the house was surrounded—but its
existence was unknown to the men before whose
blows the other doors were already beginning to
splinter. And suddenly through this door
appeared Lady Wrothley. She had only recently
married Sir James: in fact, her first baby
was then on its way. Sir James saw her, and
at once ceased his quarrel with Sir Henry. With
dignity he mounted the stairs and approached
his girl-wife—and in her horror-struck eyes he
saw that she, too, suspected him of being the
traitor. He raised her hand to his lips; and
then as the doors burst open simultaneously and
Wolsey’s men rushed in—he dived headforemost
on to the floor below, breaking his neck and dying
instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The story goes on to say,” continued Mr.
Williams, with a diffident cough, “that even
while the butchery began in the room below—for
most of the Protestants were unarmed—the poor
girl collapsed in the gallery, and shortly afterwards
the child was born. A girl baby, who
survived, though the mother died. One likes to
think that if she had indeed misjudged her
husband, it was a merciful act on the part of
the Almighty to let her join him so soon. Thank
you, I will have another cup of tea. One lump,
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most fascinating story, Mr. Williams,”
said Phyllis. “Thank you so much for having
told us. Can you make anything out of it,
Tom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The criminal reserves his defence. But it’s
most interesting, Padre, most interesting, as Mrs.
Drage says. If I may, I’d like to come and see
that manuscript.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be only too delighted,” he murmured
with old-fashioned courtesy. “Whenever you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the conversation turned on things
parochial until he rose to go. The others had
still not returned, and for a while we two sat
on talking as the spirit moved us in the darkening
room. At last the servants appeared to draw
the curtains, and it was then that we heard
Jack and Bill in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t know what made me make the remark;
it seemed to come without my volition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were you, Phyllis,” I said, “I don’t
think I’d tell the story of the dining-room to
Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know—but I wouldn’t.” In the
brightly lit room his fears of the morning seemed
ridiculous; yet, as I say, I don’t know what
made me make the remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; I won’t,” she said gravely. “Do
you think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But further conversation was cut short by the
entrance of Bill and her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve miles if an inch,” growled Drage,
throwing himself into a chair. “You awful
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sibton laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you good, you lazy devil. He’s getting
too fat, Phyllis, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I glanced at him as he, too, sat down: in his
eyes there remained no trace of the terror of the
morning.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>And now I come to that part of my story
which I find most difficult to write. From the
story-teller’s point of view pure and simple, it is
the easiest; from the human point of view I
have never tackled anything harder. Because,
though the events I am describing took place
months ago—and the first shock is long since
past—I still cannot rid myself of a feeling that I
was largely to blame. By the cold light of
reason I can exonerate myself; but one does not
habitually have one’s being in that exalted
atmosphere. Jack blames himself; but in view
of what happened the night before—in view of
the look in Bill’s eyes that Sunday morning—I
feel that I ought to have realised that there were
influences at work which lay beyond my ken—influences
which at present lie not within the
light of reason. And then at other times I
wonder if it was not just a strange coincidence
and an—accident. God knows: frankly, I
don’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spent that evening just as we had spent
the preceding one, save that in view of shooting
on Monday morning we went to bed at midnight.
This time I fell asleep at once—only to be roused
by someone shaking my arm. I sat up blinking:
it was Jack Drage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, Tom,” he whispered. “There’s
a light in the dining-room, and we’re going down
to investigate. Dick is getting Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant I was out of bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s probably Bill himself,” I said. “I
found him down there last night walking in his
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil you did!” muttered Jack, and
at that moment Dick Armytage came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill’s room is empty,” he announced; and
I nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Bill right enough,” I said. “He went
back quite quietly last night. And, for Heaven’s
sake, you fellows, don’t wake him. It’s very
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as before the dining-room door was open,
and the light filtered through into the passage
as we tiptoed along it. Just as before we saw
Bill standing by the table—his hand outstretched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the same words as I had heard
last night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie, Sir Henry!—you lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil——” muttered Jack; but
I held up my finger to ensure silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll come to bed now,” I whispered.
“Keep quite still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this time Bill Sibton did not come to bed;
instead, he turned and stared into the shadows of
the musicians’ gallery. Then, very slowly, he
walked away from us and commenced to mount
the stairs. And still the danger did not strike
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dimly we saw the tall figure reach the top and
walk along the gallery, as if he saw someone at
the end—and at that moment the peril came to
the three of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Dick and Jack the rottenness of the
balustrade; to me—<span class='it'>the end of the vicar’s story</span>.
What they thought I know not; but to my dying
day I shall never forget my own agony of mind.
In that corner of the musicians’ gallery—though
we could see her not—stood Lady Wrothley; to
the man walking slowly towards her the door
was opening slowly—the door which had remained
shut the night before—the door behind
which lay the terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then it all happened very quickly. In a
frenzy we raced across the room, to get at him—but
we weren’t in time. There was a rending of
wood—a dreadful crash—a sprawling figure on
the floor below. To me it seemed as if he had
hurled himself against the balustrade, had
literally dived downwards. The others did not
notice it—so they told me later. But I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then we were kneeling beside him on the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear God!” I heard Drage say in a hoarse
whisper. “He’s dead; he’s broken his neck.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:2em;'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is my story. Jack Drage blames himself
for the rottenness of the woodwork, but I feel
it was my fault. Yes—it was my fault. I ought
to have known, ought to have done something.
Even if we’d only locked the dining-room door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the last link in the chain I haven’t
mentioned yet. The vicar supplied that—though
to him it was merely a strange coincidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby-girl—born in the gallery—a strange,
imaginative child, so run the archives, subject
to fits of awful depression and, at other times,
hallucinations—married. She married in 1551,
on the 30th day of October, Henry, only son of
Frank Sibton and Mary his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God knows: I don’t. It may have been an
accident.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“But</span>, Bill, I don’t understand. How much did
you borrow from this man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sybil Daventry looked at her brother, sitting
huddled up in his chair, with a little frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I borrowed a thousand,” he answered,
sulkily. “And like a fool I didn’t read the
thing he made me sign—at least, not carefully.
Hang it, I’ve only had the money six months,
and now he’s saying that I owe him over two. I
saw something about twenty-five per cent., and
now I find it was twenty-five per cent. a month.
And the swine is pressing for payment unless——”
He broke off and stared into the fire
shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless what?” demanded his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, it’s this way.” The boy
stammered a little, and refused to look at her.
“I was jolly well up the spout when this blighter
told me what I owed him, and I suppose I must
have showed it pretty clearly. Anyway, I was
propping up the bar at the Cri., getting a cocktail,
when a fellow standing next me started gassing.
Not a bad sort of cove at all; knows you very
well by sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knows me?” said the girl, bewildered.
“Who was he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming to that later,” went on her
brother. “Well, we had a couple more and
then he suggested tearing a chop together. And
I don’t know—he seemed so decent and all that—that
I told him I was in the soup. Told him
the whole yarn and asked his advice sort of
business. Well, as I say, he was bally sporting
about it all, and finally asked me who the bird
was who had tied up the boodle. I told him,
and here’s the lucky part of the whole show—this
fellow Perrison knew him. Perrison was
the man I was lunching with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused and lit a cigarette, while the girl
stared at him gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said at length, “go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was after lunch that he got busy. He
said to me: ‘Look here, Daventry, you’ve made
a bally fool of yourself, but you’re not the first.
I’ll write a note to Messrs. Smith and Co.’—those
are the warriors who gave me the money—‘and
try and persuade them to give you more
time, or even possibly reduce the rate of interest.’
Of course, I was all on this, and I arranged to
lunch with him again next day, after Smith and
Co. had had time to function. And sure enough
they did. Wrote a letter in which they were all
over me; any friend of Mr. Perrison’s was
entitled to special treatment, and so on and so
forth. Naturally I was as bucked as a dog with
two tails, and asked Perrison if I couldn’t do
something more material than just thank him.
And—er—he—I mean it was then he told me
he knew you by sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at his sister, and then quickly
looked away again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He suggested—er—that perhaps I could
arrange to introduce him to you; that it would
be an honour he would greatly appreciate, and
all that sort of rot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was sitting very still. “Yes,” she
said, quietly, “and you—agreed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I did. Hang it, he’s quite a
decent fellow. Bit Cityish to look at, and I
shouldn’t think he knows which end of a horse
goes first. But he’s got me out of the devil of
a hole, Sybil, and the least you can do is to be
moderately decent to the bird. I mean it’s
not asking much, is it? I left the governor
looking at him in the hall as if he was just going
to tread on his face, and that long slab—your
pal—is gazing at him through his eyeglasses as if
he was mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not my pal, Bill.” Sybil Daventry’s
colour heightened a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you asked him here, anyway,” grunted
the boy. Then with a sudden change of tone he
turned to her appealingly. “Syb, old girl—for
the Lord’s sake play the game. You know what
the governor is, and if he hears about this show—especially
as it’s—as it’s not the first time—there’ll
be the deuce to pay. You know he said
last time that if it happened again he’d turn me
out of the house. And the old man is as stubborn
as a mule. I only want you to be a bit
decent to Perrison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a grave smile. “If
Mr. Perrison is satisfied with my being decent to
him, as you put it, I’m perfectly prepared to play
the game. But——” She frowned and rose abruptly.
“Come on, and I’ll have a look at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence they went downstairs. Tea had
just been brought in, and the house-party was
slowly drifting into the hall. But Sybil barely
noticed them; her eyes were fixed on the man
talking to her father. Or rather, at the moment,
her father was talking to the man, and his
remark was painfully audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a very good train back to London
at seven-thirty, Mr.—ah—Mr.——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother stepped forward. “But I say,
Dad,” he said, nervously, “I asked Perrison to
stop the night. I’ve just asked Sybil, and she
says she can fix him up somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Perrison?” With a
charming smile she held out her hand. “Of
course you must stop the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she moved away to the tea-table,
feeling agreeably relieved; it was better than
she had expected. The man was well-dressed;
perhaps, to her critical eye, a little too well-dressed—but
still quite presentable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You averted a catastrophe, Miss Daventry.”
A lazy voice beside her interrupted her thoughts,
and with a smile she turned to the speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad is most pestilentially rude at times,
isn’t he? And Bill told me he left <span class='it'>you</span> staring
at the poor man as if he was an insect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archie Longworth laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d just contradicted your father flatly as
you came downstairs. And on a matter concerning
horses. However—the breeze has
passed. But, tell me,” he stared at her gravely,
“why the sudden invasion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyebrows went up a little. “May I ask
why not?” she said, coldly. “Surely my
brother can invite a friend to the house if he
wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stand corrected,” answered Longworth,
quietly. “Has he known him long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t an idea,” said the girl. “And
after all, Mr. Longworth, I hadn’t known you
very long when I asked you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, because she realised that there was
a possibility of construing rather more into her
words than she had intended, she turned abruptly
to speak to another guest. So she failed to see
the sudden inscrutable look that came into
Archie Longworth’s keen blue eyes—the quick
clenching of his powerful fists. But when a few
minutes later she again turned to him, he was
just his usual lazy self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think your logic is very good?” he
demanded. “You might have made a mistake
as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that you think my brother has?”
she said, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is visible on the surface to the expert
eye,” he returned, gravely. “But, in addition,
I happen to have inside information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know Mr. Perrison, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “Yes, I have—er—met him
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he doesn’t know you,” cried the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—at least—er—we’ll leave it at that.
And I would be obliged, Miss Daventry, in case
you happen to be speaking to him, if you would
refrain from mentioning the fact that I know
him.” He stared at her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very mysterious, Mr. Longworth,”
said the girl, with an attempt at lightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I may I will prolong my visit until
our friend departs,” continued Longworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” she said, bending over the
tea-tray. “You weren’t thinking of going—going
yet, were you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking after lunch that I should
have to go to-morrow,” he said, putting down his
tea-cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why so soon?” she asked, and her
voice was low. “Aren’t you enjoying yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the course of a life that has taken me into
every corner of the globe,” he answered, slowly,
“I have never dreamed that I could be so
utterly and perfectly happy as I have been here.
It has opened my mind to a vista of the Things
that Might Be—if the Things that Had Been
were different. But as you grow older, Sybil,
you will learn one bitter truth: no human being
can ever be exactly what he seems. Masks?
just masks! And underneath—God and that
being alone know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose abruptly, and she watched him bending
over Lady Granton with his habitual lazy
grace. The indolent smile was round his lips—the
irrepressible twinkle was in his eyes. But
for the first time he had called her Sybil; for
the first time—she <span class='it'>knew</span>. The vague forebodings
conjured up by his words were swamped by that
one outstanding fact; she <span class='it'>knew</span>. And nothing
else mattered.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until Perrison joined her in the
conservatory after dinner that she found herself
called on to play the part set her by her
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had gone there—though nothing would
have induced her to admit the fact—in the hope
that someone else would follow: the man with
the lazy blue eyes and the eyeglass. And then
instead of him had come Perrison, with a shade
too much deference in his manner, and a shade
too little control of the smirk on his face. With
a sudden sick feeling she realised at that moment
exactly where she stood. Under a debt of
obligation to this man—under the necessity of a
<span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> with him, one, moreover, when, if she
was to help Bill, she must endeavour to be extra
nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the conversation was commonplace,
while she feverishly longed for someone to
come in and relieve the tension. But Bridge
was in progress, and there was Snooker in the
billiard-room, and at length she resigned herself
to the inevitable. Presumably she would have
to thank him for his kindness to Bill; after all
he undoubtedly had been very good to her
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill has told me, Mr. Perrison, how kind
you’ve been in the way you’ve helped him
in this—this unfortunate affair.” She plunged
valiantly, and gave a sigh of relief as she cleared
the first fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perrison waved a deprecating hand. “Don’t
mention it, Miss Daventry, don’t mention it.
But—er—of course, something will have to be
done, and—well, there’s no good mincing matters—done
very soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s face grew a little white, but her
voice was quite steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he told me that you had arranged things
with these people. Please smoke, if you want
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perrison bowed his thanks and carefully
selected a cigarette. The moment for which he
had been playing had now arrived, in circumstances
even more favourable than he had dared
to hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to a point that is quite true,” he remarked,
quietly. “Messrs. Smith and Co. have
many ramifications of business—money-lending
being only one of the irons they have in the fire.
And because I have had many dealings with the
firm professionally—over the sale of precious
stones, I may say, which is my own particular
line of work—they were disposed to take a
lenient view about the question of the loan. Not
press for payment, and perhaps—though I can’t
promise this—even be content with a little less
interest. But—er—Miss Daventry, it’s the
other thing where the trouble is going to occur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stared at him with dilated eyes.
“What other thing, Mr. Perrison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t your brother told you?” said
Perrison, surprised. “Oh, well, perhaps I—er—shouldn’t
have mentioned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, please.” Her voice was low. “What
is this other thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he hesitated—a well-simulated
hesitation. Then he shrugged his shoulders
slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—if you insist. As a matter of fact,
your brother didn’t tell me about it, and I only
found it out in the course of my conversation
with one of the Smith partners. Apparently
some weeks ago he bought some distinctly valuable
jewellery—a pearl-necklace, to be exact—from
a certain firm. At least, when I say he
bought it—he did not pay for it. He gave your
father’s name as a reference, and the firm considered
it satisfactory. It was worth about
eight hundred pounds, this necklace, and your
very stupid brother, instead of giving it to the
lady whom, presumably, he had got it for,
became worse than stupid. He became criminal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” The girl was looking
at him terrified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He pawned this necklace which he hadn’t
paid for, Miss Daventry, which is, I regret to say,
a criminal offence. And the trouble of the
situation is that the firm he bought the pearls
from has just found it out. He pawned it at a
place which is one of the ramifications of Smith
and Co., who gave him, I believe, a very good
price for it—over five hundred pounds. The
firm, in the course of business, two or three days
ago—and this is the incredibly unfortunate part
of it—happened to show this self-same necklace,
while they were selling other things, to the man
it had originally come from. Of course, being
pawned, it wasn’t for sale—but the man recognised
it at once. And then the fat was in the
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say,” whispered the girl,
“that—that they might send him to prison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless something is done very quickly, Miss
Daventry, the matter will certainly come into
the law courts. Messrs. Gross and Sons”—a
faint noise from the darkness at the end of the
conservatory made him swing round suddenly,
but everything was silent again—“Messrs. Gross
and Sons are very difficult people in many ways.
They are the people it came from originally, I
may tell you. And firms, somewhat naturally,
differ, like human beings. Some are disposed to
be lenient—others are not. I’m sorry to say
Gross and Sons are one of those who are not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But couldn’t you see them, or something,
and explain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Miss Daventry,” said Perrison,
gently, “I must ask you to be reasonable. What
can I explain? Your brother wanted money,
and he adopted a criminal method of getting it.
That I am afraid—ugly as it sounds—is all there
is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Mr. Perrison—can nothing be done?”
She bent forward eagerly, her hands clasped, her
lips slightly parted; and once again came that
faint noise from the end of the conservatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Perrison was too engrossed to heed
it this time; the nearness, the appeal of this
girl, who from the time he had first seen her six
months previously at a theatre had dominated
his life, was making his senses swim. And with
it the veneer began to drop; the hairy heel
began to show, though he made a tremendous
endeavour to keep himself in check.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one thing,” he said, hoarsely.
“And I hope you will understand that I should
not have been so precipitate—except for the
urgency of your brother’s case. If I go to
Messrs. Gross and say to them that a prosecution
by them would affect me personally, I think I
could persuade them to take no further steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonder was beginning to dawn in the girl’s
eyes. “Affect you personally?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If, for instance, I could tell them that for
family reasons—urgent, strong family reasons—they
would be doing me a great service by letting
matters drop, I think they would do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose suddenly—wonder replaced by horror.
She had just realised his full meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you talking about, Mr.
Perrison?” she said, haughtily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the heel appeared in all its hairiness.
“If I may tell them,” he leered, “that I am
going to marry into the family I’ll guarantee they
will do nothing more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marry you?” The biting scorn in her tone
changed the leer to a snarl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—marry me, or see your brother jugged.
Money won’t save him—so there’s no good going
to your father. Money will square up the Smith
show—it won’t square the other.” And then
his tone changed. “Why not, little girl? I’m
mad about you; have been ever since I saw you
at a theatre six months ago. I’m pretty well
off even for these days, and——” He came
towards her, his arms outstretched, while she
backed away from him, white as a sheet. Her
hands were clenched, and it was just as she had
retreated as far as she could, and the man was
almost on her, that she saw red. One hand
went up; hit him—hit the brute—was her only
coherent thought. And the man, realising it,
paused—an ugly look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then occurred the interruption. A strangled
snort, as of a sleeper awakening, came from
behind some palms, followed by the creaking of
a chair. With a stifled curse Perrison fell back
and the girl’s hand dropped to her side as the
branches parted and Archie Longworth, rubbing
his eyes, stepped into the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord save us, Miss Daventry, I’ve been
asleep,” he said, stifling a yawn. “I knew I
oughtn’t to have had a third glass of port.
Deuced bad for the liver, but very pleasant for
all that, isn’t it, Mr.—Mr. Perrison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled engagingly at the scowling Perrison,
and adjusted his eyeglass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sleep very silently, Mr. Longworth,”
snarled that worthy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—used to win prizes for it at an infant
school. Most valuable asset in class. If one
snores it disconcerts the lecturer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perrison swung round on his heel. “I would
like an answer to my suggestion by to-morrow,
Miss Daventry,” he said, softly. “Perhaps I
might have the pleasure of a walk where people
don’t sleep off the effects of dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a slight bow he left the conservatory,
and the girl sat down weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleasant type of bird, isn’t he?” drawled
Longworth, watching Perrison’s retreating
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a brute—an utter brute,” whispered the
girl, shakily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought the interview would leave you
with that impression,” agreed the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up quickly. “Did you hear what was
said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every word. That’s why I was there.” He
smiled at her calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why didn’t you come out sooner?”
she cried, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to hear what he had to say, and
at the same time I didn’t want you to biff him
on the jaw—which from your attitude I gathered
you were on the point of doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I’d have given anything to have
smacked his face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I’d have given anything to have
seen you do it. But—not yet. In fact, to-morrow
you’ve got to go for a walk with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I flatly refuse!” cried Sybil Daventry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than that,” continued Longworth,
calmly, “you’ve got to keep him on the hook.
Play with him; let him think he’s got a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” she demanded. “I loathe
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is absolutely essential that he
should remain here until the day after to-morrow
at the earliest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand.” She looked at him
with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will in good time.” It seemed to her
his voice was just a little weary. “Just now it
is better that you shouldn’t. Do you trust me
enough to do that, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you absolutely,” and she saw him
wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then keep him here till I come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going away, Archie?” Impulsively
she laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, first thing. I shall come back
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two they stood in silence,
then, with a gesture strangely foreign to one so
typically British, he raised her hand to his lips.
And the next instant she was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later she saw him talking earnestly to
her brother in a corner; then someone suggested
billiard-fives. An admirable game, but not one
in which it is wise to place one’s hand on the
edge of the table with the fingers over the
cushion. Especially if the owner of the hand is
not paying attention to the game. It was
Perrison’s hand, and the agony of being hit on
the fingers by a full-sized billiard ball travelling
fast must be experienced to be believed. Of
course it was an accident: Longworth was most
apologetic. But in the middle of the hideous
scene that followed she caught his lazy blue
eye and beat a hasty retreat to the hall. Unrestrained
mirth in such circumstances is not
regarded as the essence of tact.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was about ten o’clock on the morning of the
next day but one that a sharp-looking, flashily-dressed
individual presented himself at the door
of Messrs. Gross and Sons. He was of the type
that may be seen by the score any day of the
week propping up the West-end bars and discoursing
on racing form in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornin’,” he remarked. “Mr. Johnson here
yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want to see him about?”
demanded the assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell him that your hair wants cutting,”
snapped the other. “Hop along, young fellah;
as an ornament you’re a misfit. Tell Mr. Johnson
that I’ve a message from Mr. Perrison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth faded away, to return in a minute
or two with a request that the visitor would
follow him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Message from Perrison? What’s up?” Mr.
Johnson rose from his chair as the door closed
behind the assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flashy individual laughed and pulled out
his cigarette-case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s pulled it off,” he chuckled. “At the
present moment our one and only Joe is clasping
the beauteous girl to his bosom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike me pink—he hasn’t, has he?” Mr.
Johnson slapped his leg resoundingly and shook
with merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I’ve come round,” continued the
other. “From Smith, I am. Joe wants to give
her a little present on account.” He grinned
again, and felt in his pocket. “Here it is—and
he wants a receipt signed by you—acknowledging
the return of the necklace which was sent out—on
approval.” He winked heavily. “He’s infernally
deep, is Joe.” He watched the other
man as he picked up the pearls, and for a moment
his blue eyes seemed a little strained. “He
wants to give that receipt to the girl—so as to
clinch the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the dickens didn’t he ’phone me
direct?” demanded Johnson, and once again
the other grinned broadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strewth!” he said, “I laughed fit to burst
this morning. The ’phone at his girl’s place is
in the hall, as far as I could make out, and Joe
was whispering down it like an old woman with
lumbago. ‘Take ’em round to Johnson,’ he
said. ‘Approval—approval—you fool.’ And
then he turned away and I heard him say—‘Good
morning, Lady Jemima.’ Then back he
turns and starts whispering again. ‘Do you get
me, Bob?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, ‘I get you. You
want me to take round the pearls to Johnson and
get a receipt from him. And what about the
other thing—you know, the money the young
boob borrowed?’ ‘Put it in an envelope and
send it to me here, with the receipt,’ he says.
‘I’m going out walking this morning.’ Then he
rings off, and that’s that. Lord! think of Joe
walking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grin developed into a cackling laugh, in
which Mr. Johnson joined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s deep—you’re right,” he said, admiringly.
“Uncommonly deep. I never thought
he’d pull it off. Though personally, mark
you, I think he’s a fool. They’ll fight like
cat and dog.” He rang a bell on his desk
then opening a drawer he dropped the necklace
inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me a formal receipt form,” he said to
the assistant. “Have you got the other paper?”
he asked, as he affixed the firm’s signature to the
receipt, and the flashy individual produced it
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” he announced. “Put ’em both
in an envelope together and address it to Joe.
I’m going along; I’ll post it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you have a small tiddley before you
go?” Mr. Johnson opened a formidable-looking
safe, disclosing all the necessary-looking
ingredients for the manufacture of small tiddleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind if I do,” conceded the other.
“Here’s the best—and to the future Mrs. Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment or two later he passed through the
outer office and was swallowed up in the crowd.
And it was not till after lunch that day that Mr.
Johnson got the shock of his life—when he
opened one of the early evening papers.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1.2em;'>“DARING&nbsp;&nbsp;ROBBERY&nbsp;&nbsp;IN&nbsp;&nbsp;WELL-KNOWN&nbsp;&nbsp;CITY&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRM.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A most daring outrage was carried out last
night at the office of Messrs. Smith and Co., the
well-known financial and insurance brokers. At
a late hour this morning, some time after work was
commenced, the night watchman was discovered
bound and securely gagged in a room at the top of
the premises. Further investigation revealed that
the safe had been opened—evidently by a master
hand—and the contents rifled. The extent of the
loss is at present unknown, but the police are
believed to possess several clues.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And at the same time that Mr. Johnson was
staring with a glassy stare at this astounding
piece of news, a tall, spare man with lazy blue
eyes, stretched out comfortably in the corner of a
first-class carriage, was also perusing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several clues,” he murmured. “I wonder!
But it was a very creditable job, though I say it
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which seemed a strange soliloquy for a well-dressed
man in a first-class carriage. And what
might have seemed almost stranger, had there
been any way of knowing such a recondite fact,
was that in one of the mail bags reposing in the
back of the train, a mysterious transformation
had taken place. For a letter which had
originally contained two documents and had
been addressed to J. Perrison, Esq., now contained
three and was consigned to Miss Sybil
Daventry. Which merely goes to show how
careful one should be over posting letters.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mr. Perrison. All well, and
taking nourishment, so to speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archie Longworth lounged into the hall,
almost colliding with the other man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look pensive,” he continued, staring at
him blandly. “<span class='it'>Agitato, fortissimo.</span> Has aught
occurred to disturb your masterly composure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Perrison was in no mood for fooling:
a message he had just received over the telephone
had very considerably disturbed his composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me have a look at that paper,” he
snapped, making a grab at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush! Tush!” murmured Archie. “Manners,
laddie, manners! You’ve forgotten that
little word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then at the far end of the hall he saw the
girl, and caught his breath. For the last two
days he had almost forgotten her in the stress
of other things; now the bitterness of what had
to come rose suddenly in his throat and choked
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the paper. Run away and play in
a corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went forward to meet her with his
usual lazy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s happened?” she cried, a little
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaps of things,” he said, gently. “Heaps
of things. The principal one being that a very
worthless sinner loves a very beautiful girl—as
he never believed it could be given to man to
love.” His voice broke and faltered: then he
went on steadily. “And the next one—which
is really even more important—is that the very
beautiful girl will receive a letter in a long
envelope by to-night’s mail. The address will be
typed, the postmark Strand. I do not want the
beautiful girl to open it except in my presence.
You understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” she whispered, and her eyes
were shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen this?” Perrison’s voice—shaking
with rage—made Longworth swing
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen what, dear lad?” he murmured, taking
the paper. “Robbery in City—is that what you
mean? Dear, dear—what dastardly outrages
do go unpunished these days! Messrs. Smith and
Co. Really! Watchman bound and gagged.
Safe rifled. Work of a master hand. Still,
though I quite understand your horror as a law-abiding
citizen at such a thing, why this thusness?
I mean—altruism is wonderful, laddie;
but it seems to me that it’s jolly old Smith and
Co. who are up the pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He burbled on genially, serenely unconscious
of the furious face of the other man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying to think where I’ve met you
before, Mr. Longworth,” snarled Perrison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, surely,” murmured the other.
“Those classic features, I feel sure, would have
been indelibly printed on my mind. Perhaps in
some mission, Mr. Perrison—some evangelical
revival meeting. Who knows? And there, if I
mistake not, is the mail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at the girl, and she was staring at
him wonderingly. Just for one moment did he
show her what she wanted to know—just for one
moment did she give him back the answer which
was to him the sweetest and at the same time
the most bitter in the world. Then he crossed
the hall and picked up the letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A business one for you, Miss Daventry,” he
murmured, mildly. “Better open it at once, and
get our business expert’s advice. Mr. Perrison
is a wonderful fellah for advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With trembling fingers she opened the envelope,
and, as he saw the contents, Perrison, with
a snarl of ungovernable fury, made as if to
snatch them out of her hand. The next moment
he felt as if his arm was broken, and the blue
eyes boring into his brain were no longer lazy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forgot yourself, Mr. Perrison,” said
Archie Longworth, gently. “Don’t do that
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t understand,” cried the girl, bewildered.
“What are these papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I see?” Longworth held out his hand,
and she gave them to him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re stolen.” Perrison’s face was livid.
“Give them to me, curse you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Control yourself, you horrible blighter,” said
Longworth, icily. “This,” he continued, calmly,
“would appear to be a receipt from Messrs. Gross
and Sons for the return of a pearl-necklace—sent
out to Mr. Daventry on approval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said he’d bought it and pawned it.”
She turned furiously on Perrison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he did,” snarled that gentleman. “That’s
a forgery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said Longworth. “That strikes
me as being Johnson’s signature. Firm’s official
paper. And—er—he has the necklace, I—er—assume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—he has the necklace. Stolen last night
by—by——” His eyes were fixed venomously
on Longworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” murmured the other. “You’re
being most entertaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a sudden change had come over Perrison’s
face—a dawning recognition. “By God!” he
muttered, “you’re—you’re——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’m—who? It’ll come in time,
laddie—if you give it a chance. And in the
meantime we might examine these other papers.
Now, this appears to my inexperienced eye to be
a transaction entered into on the one part by
Messrs. Smith and Co. and on the other by
William Daventry. And it concerns filthy lucre.
Dear, dear. Twenty-five per cent. per month.
Three hundred per cent. Positive usury, Mr.
Perrison. Don’t you agree with me? A
rapacious bloodsucker is Mr. Smith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the other man was not listening: full
recollection had come to him, and with a cold
look of triumph he put his hands into his pockets
and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty,” he remarked. “Very pretty
indeed. And how, in your vernacular, do you
propose to get away with the swag, Mr. Flash
Pete? I rather think the police—whom I
propose to call up on the ’phone in one minute—will
be delighted to see such an old and elusive
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at the girl, and laughed again at
the look on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he mean, Archie?” she cried,
wildly. “What’s he mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” Perrison sneered, “that Mr.
Archie Longworth is what is generally described
as a swell crook with a reputation in certain
unsavoury circles extending over two or three
continents. And the police, whom I propose
to ring up, will welcome him as a long-lost
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked towards the telephone, and with a
little gasp of fear the girl turned to Archie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say it’s not true, dear—say it’s not true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he looked at her with a whimsical
smile; then he sat down on the high fender
round the open fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Mr. Perrison,” he murmured, gently,
“that if I were you I would not be too precipitate
over ringing up the police. The engaging
warrior who sent this letter to Miss Daventry
put in yet one more enclosure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perrison turned round: then he stood very
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most peculiar document,” continued the
man by the fire, in the same gentle voice, “which
proves very conclusively that amongst their
other activities Messrs. Smith and Co. are not
only the receivers of stolen goods, but are mixed
up with illicit diamond buying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In dead silence the two men stared at one
another; then Longworth spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall keep these three documents, Mr.
Perrison, as a safeguard for your future good
behaviour. Mr. Daventry can pay a certain fair
sum or not as he likes—that is his business: and
I shall make a point of explaining exactly to him
who and what you are—and Smith—and Gross.
But should you be disposed to make any trouble
over the necklace—or should the idea get abroad
that Flash Pete was responsible for the burglary
last night—it will be most unfortunate for you—most.
This document would interest Scotland
Yard immensely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perrison’s face had grown more and more livid
as he listened, and when the quiet voice ceased,
unmindful of the girl standing by, he began to
curse foully and hideously. The next moment
he cowered back, as two iron hands gripped
his shoulders and shook him till his teeth
rattled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, you filthy swine,” snarled Longworth,
“or I’ll break every bone in your body. Quite
a number of men are blackguards, Perrison—but
you’re a particularly creeping and repugnant
specimen. Now—get out—and do it quickly.
The nine-thirty will do you nicely. And don’t
forget what I’ve just said: because, as there’s a
God above, I mean it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be even with you for this some day,
Flash Pete,” said the other venomously over his
shoulder. “And then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then,” said Longworth, contemptuously,
“we will resume this discussion. Just
now—get out.”</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: it is quite true.” She had known it
was—and yet, womanlike, she had clung to the
hope that there was some mistake—some explanation.
And now, alone with the man she
had grown to love, the faint hope died. With
his lazy smile, he stared down at her—a smile so
full of sorrow and pain that she could not bear
to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Flash Pete—with an unsavoury reputation,
as our friend so kindly told you, in three
continents. It was I who broke open the safe
at Smith’s last night, I who got the receipt from
Gross. You see, I spotted the whole trick from
the beginning; as I said, I had inside information.
And Perrison is Smith and Co.; moreover
he’s very largely Gross as well—and half a dozen
other rotten things in addition. The whole
thing was worked with one end in view right
from the beginning: the girl your brother
originally bought the pearls for was in it; it was
she who suggested the pawning. Bill told me
that the night before last.” He sighed and paced
two or three times up and down the dim-lit
conservatory. And after a while he stopped in
front of her again, and his blue eyes were very
tender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a common sneak-thief—just a common
worthless sinner. And he’s very, very glad that
he has been privileged to help the most beautiful
girl in all the world. Don’t cry, my dear, don’t
cry: there’s nothing about that sinner’s that’s
worth a single tear of yours. You must forget
his wild presumption in falling in love with that
beautiful girl: his only excuse is that he couldn’t
help it. And maybe, in the days to come, the
girl will think kindly every now and then of a
man known to some as Archie Longworth—known
to others as Flash Pete—known to himself
as—well, we won’t bother about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent quickly and raised her hand to his
lips; then he was gone almost before she had
realised it. And if he heard her little gasping
cry—“Archie, my man, come back—I love you
so!” he gave no sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For in his own peculiar code a very worthless
sinner must remain a very worthless sinner to
the end—and he must run the course alone.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“What</span> a queer little place, Jimmy!” The
girl glanced round the tiny restaurant with frank
interest, and the man looked up from the menu
he was studying with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let François hear you say that, or
you’ll be asked to leave.” The head-waiter was
already bearing down on them, his face wreathed
in an expansive smile of welcome. “To him it
is the only restaurant in London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, m’sieur! it is long days since you were
here.” The little Frenchman rubbed his hands
together delightedly. “And mam’selle—it is
your first visit to Les Coquelins, n’est-ce-pas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the last, I hope, François,” said the
girl with a gentle smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, mais non!” Outraged horror at such
an impossible idea shone all over the head-waiter’s
face. “My guests, mam’selle, they
come here once to see what it is like—and they
return because they know what it is like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy Lethbridge laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, Molly,” he cried. “Now you
know what’s expected of you. Nothing less than
once a week—eh, François?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mais oui, m’sieur. There are some who come
every night.” He produced his pencil and stood
waiting. “A few oysters,” he murmured.
“They are good ce soir: real Whitstables. And
a bird, M’sieur Lethbridge—with an omelette aux
fines herbes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds excellent, François,” laughed the
man. “Anyway, I know that once you have
decided—argument is futile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my work,” answered the waiter, shrugging
his shoulders. “And a bottle of Corton—with
the chill just off. Toute de suite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>François bustled away, and the girl looked
across the table with a faintly amused smile in
her big grey eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He fits the place, Jimmy. You must bring
me here again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as often as you like, Molly,” answered
the man quietly, and after a moment the girl
turned away. “You know,” he went on steadily,
“how much sooner I’d bring you to a spot like
this, than go to the Ritz or one of those big places.
Only I was afraid it might bore you. I love it:
it’s so much more intimate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you think it would bore me?”
she asked, drawing off her gloves and resting her
hands on the table in front of her. They were
beautiful hands, ringless save for one plain signet
ring on the little finger of her left hand. And,
almost against his will, the man found himself
staring at it as he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I can’t trust myself, dear; I can’t
trust myself to amuse you,” he answered slowly.
“I can’t trust myself not to make love to you—and
it’s so much easier here than in the middle
of a crowd whom one knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sighed a little sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jimmy, I wish I could! You’ve been
such an absolute dear. Give me a little longer,
old man, and then—perhaps——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said the man hoarsely, “I don’t
want to hurry you. I’m willing to wait years for
you—years. At least”—he smiled whimsically—“I’m
not a little bit willing to wait years—really.
But if it’s that or nothing—then, believe
me, I’m more than willing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve argued it out with myself, Jimmy.”
And now she was staring at the signet ring on
her finger. “And when I’ve finished the argument,
I know that I’m not a bit further on. You
can’t argue over things like that. I’ve told
myself times out of number that it isn’t fair to
you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to speak, but she stopped him with
a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear man, it is not fair to you—whatever
you like to say. It isn’t fair to you even though
you may agree to go on waiting. No one has a
right to ask another person to wait indefinitely,
though I’m thinking that is exactly what I’ve
been doing. Which is rather like a woman,” and
once again she smiled half sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m willing to wait, dear,” he repeated
gently. “And then I’m willing to take just as
much as you care to give. I won’t worry you,
Molly; I won’t ask you for anything you don’t
feel like granting me. You see, I know now that
Peter must always come first. I had hoped that
you’d forget him; I still hope, dear, that in time
you will——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head, and the man bit his lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, even if you don’t, Molly,” he went on
steadily, “is it fair to yourself to go on when you
know it’s hopeless? There can be no doubt now
that he’s dead; you know it yourself—you’ve
taken off your engagement ring—and is it fair
to—you? Don’t worry about me for the
moment—but what is the use? Isn’t it better
to face facts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl gave a little laugh that was half a
sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is, Jimmy. Much better. I
always tell myself that in my arguments.” Then
she looked at him steadily across the table.
“You’d be content, Jimmy—would you?—with
friendship at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered quietly. “I would be
content with friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you wouldn’t bother me—ah, no!
forgive me, I know you wouldn’t. Because,
Jimmy, I don’t want there to be any mistake.
People think I’ve got over it because I go about;
in some ways I have. But I seem to have lost
something—some part of me. I don’t think I
shall ever be able to <span class='it'>love</span> a man again. I like
you, Jimmy—like you most frightfully—but I
don’t know whether I’ll ever be able to love you
in the way I loved Peter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” muttered the man. “And
I’ll risk it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear!” said the girl—and her eyes were
shining. “That’s where the unfairness comes in.
You’re worth the very best—and I can’t promise
to give it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the very best, whatever you give
me,” answered the man quietly. “I’d sooner
have anything from you than everything from
another woman. Oh, my dear!” he burst out,
“I didn’t mean to worry you to-night—though I
knew this damned restaurant would be dangerous—but
can’t you say yes? I swear you’ll never
regret it, dear—and I—I’ll be quite content to
know that you care just a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the girl was silent; then with a
faint smile she looked at him across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Jimmy,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you will, Molly?” he cried, a
little breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the girl nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, old man,” she answered steadily. “I
mean I will.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:2em;'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two hours later when Molly Daventry
went slowly upstairs to her room and shut the
door. Jimmy Lethbridge had just gone; she
had just kissed him. And the echo of his last
whispered words—“My dear! my very dear
girl!”—was still sounding in her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while she stood by the fireplace smiling
a little sadly. Then she crossed the room and
switched on a special light. It was so placed
that it shone directly on the photograph of an
officer in the full dress of the 9th Hussars. And
at length she knelt down in front of the table on
which the photograph stood, so that the light fell
on her own face also—glinting through the red-gold
of her hair, glistening in the mistiness of her
eyes. For maybe five minutes she knelt there,
till it seemed to her as if a smile twitched round
the lips of the officer—a human smile, an understanding
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Peter!” she whispered, “he was your
pal. Forgive me, my love—forgive me. He’s
been such a dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And once again the photograph seemed to smile
at her tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only you, Peter, till Journey’s End—but
I must give him the next best, mustn’t I?
It’s only fair, isn’t it?—and you hated unfairness.
But, dear God! it’s hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly she stretched out her left hand, so that
the signet ring touched the big silver frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your ring, Peter,” she whispered, “your
dear ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with a sudden little choking gasp she
raised it to her lips.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was in a side-street close to High Street,
Kensington, that it happened—the unbelievable
thing. Fate decided to give Jimmy two months
of happiness; cynically allowed him to come
within a fortnight of his wedding, and then——</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few seconds he couldn’t believe his eyes;
he stood staring like a man bereft of his senses.
There on the opposite side of the road, playing a
barrel-organ, was Peter himself—Peter, who had
been reported “Missing, believed killed,” three
years before. Peter, whom a sergeant had
categorically said he had seen killed with his own
eyes. And there he was playing a barrel-organ
in the streets of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a man partially dazed Jimmy Lethbridge
went over towards him. As he approached the
player smiled genially, and touched his cap with
his free hand. Then after a while the smile
faded, and he stared at Jimmy suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Peter!” Lethbridge heard himself
say, “what are you doing this for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke he saw a girl approaching—a
girl who placed herself aggressively beside
Peter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t I?” demanded the player.
“And who the hell are you calling Peter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” stammered Jimmy, “don’t you know
me, old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” returned the other truculently.
“And I don’t want to, neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ruddy torf, ’e is, Bill,” chimed in the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” muttered Lethbridge, even
then failing to understand the situation. “You
playing a barrel-organ!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, ’op it, guv’nor.” Peter spoke
with dangerous calmness. “I don’t want no
blinking scenes ’ere. The police ain’t too friendly
as it is, and this is my best pitch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t you let your pals know you
were back, old man?” said Jimmy feebly.
“Your governor, and all of us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See ’ere, mister,” the girl stepped forward,
“ ’e ain’t got no pals—only me. Ain’t that so,
Billy?” she turned to the man, who nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looks after him, I do, d’yer see?” went on
the girl. “And I don’t want no one coming
butting their ugly heads in. It worries ’im, it
does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you mean to say——” began Jimmy
dazedly, and then he broke off. At last he understood,
something if not all. In some miraculous
way Peter had not been killed; Peter was there
in front of him—but a new Peter; a Peter whose
memory of the past had completely gone, whose
mind was as blank as a clean-washed slate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you been doing this?” he
asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind,” said the girl sharply.
“He ain’t nothing to you. I looks after ’im, I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for a second did Jimmy hesitate, though
deep down inside him there came a voice that
whispered—“Don’t be a fool! Pretend it’s a
mistake. Clear off! Molly will never know.”
And if for a moment his hands clenched with the
strength of the sudden hideous temptation, his
voice was calm and quiet as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where you’re wrong.” He looked
at her gently. “He is something to me—my
greatest friend, whom I thought was dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Peter was staring at him fixedly,
forgetting even to turn the handle of the machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember yer, guv’nor,” he said,
and Jimmy flinched at the appalling accent.
“I’ve kind o’ lost my memory, yer see, and
Lizzie ’ere looks after me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she does,” continued Jimmy quietly.
“Thank you, Lizzie, thank you a thousand times.
But I want you both to come to this house to-night.”
He scribbled the address of his rooms
on a slip of paper. “We must think what is best
to be done. You see, Lizzie, it’s not quite fair
to him, is it? I want to get a good doctor to see
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m quite ’appy as I am, sir,” said Peter.
“I don’t want no doctors messing about with
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yer’d better go, Bill.” The girl turned to
him. “The gentleman seems kind. But”—she
swung round on Jimmy fiercely—“you ain’t
going to take ’im away from me, guv’nor? ’E’s
mine, yer see—mine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to come with him to-night,
Lizzie,” said Lethbridge gravely. “I’m not
going to try and take him away from you. I
promise that. But will you promise to come?
It’s for his sake I ask you to bring him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while she looked at him half fearfully;
then she glanced at Peter, who had apparently
lost interest in the matter. And at last she
muttered under her breath: “Orl right—I’ll
bring him. But ’e’s mine—mine. An’ don’t yer
go forgetting it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jimmy, walking slowly into the main
street, carried with him the remembrance of a
small determined face with the look on it of a
mother fighting for her young. That and Peter;
poor dazed memory-lost Peter—his greatest pal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, as he turned towards Piccadilly, he
grasped nothing save the one stupendous fact that
Peter was not dead. Then, as he walked on,
gradually the realisation of what it meant to him
personally came to his mind. And with that
realisation there returned with redoubled force
the insidious tempting voice that had first
whispered: “Molly will never know.” She
would never know—could never know—unless
he told her. And Peter was happy; he’d said
so. And the girl was happy—Lizzie. And
perhaps—in fact most likely—Peter would never
recover his memory. So what was the use?
Why say anything about it? Why not say it was
a mistake when they came that evening? And
Jimmy put his hand to his forehead and found it
was wet with sweat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, if Peter didn’t recover, it would
only mean fearful unhappiness for everyone.
He wouldn’t know Molly, and it would break her
heart, and the girl’s, and—but, of course, <span class='it'>he</span>
didn’t count. It was the others he was thinking
of—not himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned into the Park opposite the Albert
Hall, and passers-by eyed him strangely, though
he was supremely unaware of the fact. But
when all the demons of hell are fighting inside a
man, his face is apt to look grey and haggard.
And as he walked slowly towards Hyde Park
Corner, Jimmy Lethbridge went through his
Gethsemane. They thronged him; pressing in
on him from all sides, and he cursed the devils out
loud. But still they came back, again and again,
and the worst and most devilish of them all was
the insidious temptation that by keeping silent
he would be doing the greatest good for the
greatest number. Everyone was happy now—why
run the risk of altering things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, because it is not good that man
should be tempted till he breaks, the Fate that
had led him to Peter, led him gently out of the
Grim Garden into Peace once more. He gave a
short hard laugh which was almost a sob, and
turning into Knightsbridge he hailed a taxi.
It was as it drew up at the door of Molly’s house
that he laughed again—a laugh that had lost its
hardness. And the driver thought his fare’s
“Thank you” was addressed to him. Perhaps
it was. Perhaps it was the first time Jimmy had
prayed for ten years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jimmy, old man—you’re early, I’m
not dressed yet.” Molly met him in the hall, and
he smiled at her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind, dear,” he said, “if I cry off to-night?
I’ve got a very important engagement—even
more important than taking you out to
dinner, if possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile grew whimsical, and he put both his
hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It concerns my wedding present for you,”
he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the bridegroom to the bride?” she
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that,” he said, turning away
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, dear,” she answered. “As a
matter of fact, I’ve got a bit of a head. Though
what present you can be getting at this time of
day, I can’t think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t try to,” said Jimmy. “It’s
a surprise, Molly—a surprise. Pray God you like
it, and that it will be a success!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke low under his breath, and the girl
looked at him curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, dear?” she cried. “Has
something happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy Lethbridge pulled himself together;
he didn’t want her to suspect anything yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens, no!” he laughed. “What
should have? But I want to borrow something
from you, Molly dear, and I don’t want you to ask
any questions. I want you to lend me that
photograph of Peter that you’ve got—the one in
full dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she was staring at him wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy,” she said breathlessly, “does it
concern the present?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; it concerns the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to have a picture of him
painted for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that,” he answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you dear!” she whispered, “you
dear! I’ve been thinking about it for months.
I’ll get it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went upstairs, and the man stood still
in the hall staring after her. And he was still
standing motionless as she came down again, the
precious frame clasped in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll take care of it, Jimmy?” she said,
and he nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for a moment she laid her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think, old man,” she said quietly,
“that you’ll have to wait very long with
friendship only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment she was alone with the slam
of the front-door echoing in her ears. It was like
Fate to reserve its most deadly arrow for the end.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“You say he has completely lost his
memory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mainwaring, one of the most brilliant of London’s
younger surgeons, leaned back in his chair
and looked thoughtfully at his host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he didn’t know me, and I was his
greatest friend,” said Lethbridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men were in Jimmy’s rooms, waiting
for the arrival of Peter and the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looked at me without a trace of recognition,”
continued Lethbridge. “And he’s
developed a typical lower-class Cockney accent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Interesting, very,” murmured the surgeon,
getting up and examining the photograph on the
table. “This is new, isn’t it, old boy; I’ve
never seen it before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I borrowed it this afternoon,” said Jimmy
briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From his people, I suppose? Do they
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one knows at present, Mainwaring—except
you and me. That photograph I got this
afternoon from Miss Daventry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in his tone made the surgeon swing
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean your fiancée?” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—my fiancée. You see, she was—she
was engaged to Peter. And she thinks he’s
dead. That is the only reason she got engaged
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment there was silence, while Mainwaring
stared at the other. A look of wonder
had come into the doctor’s eyes—wonder mixed
with a dawning admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my God! old man,” he muttered at
length, “if the operation is successful——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you think of a better wedding present to
give a girl than the man she loves?” said
Jimmy slowly, and the doctor turned away.
There are times when it is not good to look on
another man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if it isn’t successful?” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows, Bill. I haven’t got as far as
that—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was at that moment that there came a
ring at the front-door bell. There was a brief
altercation; then Jimmy’s man appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two—er—persons say you told them——”
he began, when Lethbridge cut him short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show them in at once,” he said briefly, and
his man went out again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to remember, Bill,” said Jimmy
as they waited, “that Peter Staunton is literally,
at the moment, a low-class Cockney.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mainwaring nodded, and drew back a little as
Peter and the girl came into the room. He
wanted to leave the talking to Jimmy, while he
watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Lizzie,” Lethbridge smiled at
the girl reassuringly. “I’m glad you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s that cove?” demanded the girl
suspiciously, staring at Mainwaring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A doctor,” said Jimmy. “I want him to
have a look at Peter later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name ain’t Peter,” muttered the girl
sullenly. “It’s Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, at Bill, then. Don’t be frightened,
Lizzie; come farther into the room. I want you
to see a photograph I’ve got here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a dog who wonders whether it is safe to
go to a stranger, she advanced slowly, one step
at a time; while Peter, twirling his cap awkwardly
in his hands, kept beside her. Once or
twice he glanced uneasily round the room, but
otherwise his eyes were fixed on Lizzie as a child
looks at its mother when it’s scared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Jimmy!” whispered the doctor,
“there’s going to be as big a sufferer as you if
we’re successful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was looking as he spoke at the girl,
who, with a sudden instinctive feeling of
protection, had put out her hand and taken
Peter’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a pair of frightened children they crept
on until they came to the photograph; then they
stopped in front of it. And the two men came a
little closer. It was the girl who spoke first, in
a low voice of wondering awe:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gawd! it’s you, Bill—that there bloke in
the frame. You were a blinking orficer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a look of pathetic pride on her face, she
stared first at the photograph and then at the
man beside her. “An orficer! Bill—an
orficer! What was ’is regiment, mister?”
The girl swung round on Jimmy. “Was ’e in
the Guards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Lizzie,” said Lethbridge. “Not the
Guards. He was in the cavalry. The 9th
Hussars,” and the man, who was holding the
frame foolishly in his hands, suddenly looked
up. “The Devil’s Own, Peter,” went on
Lethbridge quietly. “C Squadron of the Devil’s
Own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the look had faded; Peter’s face was
blank again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t remember, guv’nor,” he muttered.
“And it’s making me ’ead ache—this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little cry the girl caught his arm, and
faced Lethbridge fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wot’s the good of all this?” she cried.
“All this muckin’ abaht? Why the ’ell can’t
you leave ’im alone, guv’nor? ’E’s going to ’ave
one of ’is ’eads now—’e nearly goes mad, ’e does,
when ’e gets ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Lizzie, that perhaps I can cure those
heads of his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mainwaring speaking, and the girl, still
holding Peter’s arm protectingly, looked from
Lethbridge to the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I want to examine him, in another room
where the light is a little better. Just quite
alone, where he won’t be distracted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But instantly the girl was up in arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re taking ’im away from me—that’s wot
yer doing. And I won’t ’ave it. Yer don’t
want to go, Bill, do yer? Yer don’t want to
leave yer Liz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jimmy Lethbridge bit his lip; Mainwaring
had been right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to take him away, Lizzie,”
said the doctor gently. “I promise you that.
You shall see him the very instant I’ve made my
examination. But if you’re there, you see, you’ll
distract his attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a step forward, staring at the doctor
as if she would read his very soul. And in the
infinite pathos of the scene, Jimmy Lethbridge
for the moment forgot his own suffering. Lizzie—the
little slum girl—fighting for her man
against something she couldn’t understand;
wondering if she should trust these two strangers.
Caught in a net that frightened her; fearful
that they were going to harm Bill. And at the
bottom of everything the wild, inarticulate
terror that she was going to lose him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You swear it?” she muttered. “I can see
’im after yer’ve looked at ’im.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear it,” said Mainwaring gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a little sob. “Orl right, I believe
yer on the level. You go with ’im, Bill. Perhaps
’e’ll do yer ’ead good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E’s queer sometimes at night,” said Lizzie,
as the door closed behind Mainwaring. “Seems
all dazed like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he?” said Jimmy. “How did you find
him, Lizzie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’E was wandering round—didn’t know
nuthing about ’imself,” she answered. “And I
took ’im in—and looked after ’im, I did. Saved
and pinched a bit, ’ere and there—and then
we’ve the barrel-organ. And we’ve been so
’appy, mister—so ’appy. Course ’e’s a bit queer,
and ’e don’t remember nuthing—but ’e’s orl
right if ’e don’t get ’is ’eadaches. And when ’e
does, I gets rid of them. I jest puts ’is ’ead on
me lap and strokes ’is forehead—and they goes
after a while. Sometimes ’e goes to sleep when
I’m doing it—and I stops there till ’e wakes
again with the ’ead gone. Yer see, I understands
’im. ’E’s ’appy with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was staring at the photograph—a pathetic
little figure in her tawdry finery—and for a
moment Jimmy couldn’t speak. It had to be
done; he had to do it—but it felt rather like
killing a wounded bird with a sledge-hammer—except
that it wouldn’t be so quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a great brain surgeon, Lizzie—the
gentleman with Bill,” he said at length, and the
girl turned round and watched him gravely.
“And he thinks that an operation might cure
him and give him back his memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that ’e’d know ’e was an orficer?”
whispered the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that he’d know he was an officer,” said
Jimmy. “So that he’d remember all his past
life. You see, Lizzie, your Bill is really Sir Peter
Staunton—whom we all thought had been killed
in the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Peter Staunton!” she repeated dazedly.
“Gawd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was engaged, Lizzie,” he went on quietly,
and he heard her breath come quick—“engaged
to that lady.” He pointed to a picture of Sybil
on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one wouldn’t look at me with ’er about,”
said the girl thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loved him very dearly, Lizzie—even as
he loved her. I don’t think I’ve ever known two
people who loved one another quite so much.
And——” for a moment Jimmy faltered, then
he went on steadily: “I ought to know in this
case, because I’m engaged to her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because the Cockney brain is quick, she
saw—and understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So if yer doctor friend succeeds,” she said,
“she’ll give yer the chuck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Lizzie,” answered Jimmy gravely,
“she’ll give me the chuck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yer love ’er? Orl right, old sport. I
can see it in yer face. Strikes me”—and she
gave a little laugh that was sadder than any
tears—“strikes me you ’anded out the dirty end
of the stick to both of us when you come round
that street to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strikes me I did, Lizzie,” he agreed. “But,
you see, I’ve told you this because I want you
to understand that we’re both of us in it—we’ve
both of us got to play the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play the game!” she muttered. “Wot
d’yer want me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctor doesn’t want him excited,
Lizzie,” explained Lethbridge. “But he wants
him to stop here to-night, so that he can operate
to-morrow. Will you tell him that you want
him to stop here?—and stay here with him if
you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to-morrer she’ll tike ’im.” The girl
was staring at Sybil’s photograph. “ ’E won’t
look at me—when ’e knows. Gawd! why did
yer find ’im—why did yer find ’im? We was
’appy, I tells yer—’appy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was crying now—crying as a child cries,
weakly and pitifully, and Lethbridge stood
watching her in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor kid!” he said at length. “Poor little
kid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want yer pity,” she flared up. “I
want my man.” And then, as she saw Jimmy
looking at the photograph on the mantelpiece, in
an instant she was beside him. “Sorry, old
sport,” she whispered impulsively. “Reckon
you’ve backed a ruddy loser yourself. I’ll do
it. Shake ’ands. I guess I knew all along that
Bill wasn’t really my style. And I’ve ’ad my
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re lucky, Lizzie,” said Jimmy gravely,
still holding her hand. “Very, very lucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve ’ad my year,” she went on, and for a
moment her thoughts seemed far away. “A ’ole
year—and——” she pulled herself together and
started patting her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what, Lizzie?” said Jimmy quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind, mister,” she answered.
“That’s my blooming business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the door opened and Mainwaring
came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Lizzie agree?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bill—she agrees,” said Jimmy. “What
do you think of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as I can see there is every hope that
an operation will be completely successful.
There is evidently pressure on the right side of
the skull which can be removed. I’ll operate
early to-morrow morning. Keep him quiet
to-night—and make him sleep, Lizzie, if you
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’yer think, mister?” she said
scornfully. “Ain’t I done it fer a year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without another word she left the room, and
the two men stood staring at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she play the game, Jimmy!” Mainwaring
was lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—she’ll play the game,” answered Lethbridge
slowly. “She’ll play the game—poor
little kid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What terms are they on—those two?”
The doctor looked at him curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Lethbridge even more slowly,
“that that is a question we had better not
inquire into too closely.”</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was successful—brilliantly successful—the
operation. Lizzie made it so; at any rate she
helped considerably. It was she who held his
hand as he went under the anæsthetic; it was she
who cheered him up in the morning, when he
awoke dazed and frightened in a strange room.
And then she slipped away and disappeared from
the house. It was only later that Lethbridge
found a scrawled pencil note, strangely smudged,
on his desk:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me no wot appens.—<span class='sc'>Lizzie.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t know her address, so he couldn’t
write and tell her that her Bill had come to
consciousness again, completely recovered except
for one thing. There was another blank in his
mind now—the last three years. One of his
first questions had been to ask how the fight
had gone, and whether we’d broken through
properly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then for a day or two Lizzie was forgotten;
he had to make his own renunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Molly came, a little surprised at his unusual
invitation, and he left the door open so that she
could see Peter in bed from one part of his
sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you buried yourself, Jimmy?”
she cried. “I’ve been——” And then her face
grew deathly white as she looked into the bedroom.
Her lips moved, though no sound came
from them; her hands were clenching and
unclenching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m mad,” he heard her whisper at
length, “quite mad. I’m seeing things, Jimmy—seeing
things. Why—dear God! it’s Peter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a step or two forward, and Peter saw
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Molly,” he cried weakly, “Molly, my
darling——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jimmy Lethbridge saw her walk forward
slowly and uncertainly to the man who had come
back. With a shaking little cry of pure joy she
fell on her knees beside the bed, and Peter put a
trembling hand on her hair. Then Jimmy shut
the door, and stared blankly in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Lizzie who roused him—Lizzie coming
shyly into the room from the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seed her come in,” she whispered. “She
looked orl right. ’Ow is ’e?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got his memory back, Lizzie,” he said
gently. “But he’s forgotten the last three
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgotten me, as ’e?” Her lips quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Lizzie. Forgotten everything—barrel-organ
and all. He thinks he’s on sick leave
from the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she’s wiv ’im now, is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—she’s with him, Lizzie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a deep breath—then she walked
to the glass and arranged her hat—a dreadful hat
with feathers in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I reckons I’d better be going. I don’t
want to see ’im. It would break me ’eart. And
I said good-bye to ’im that last night before the
operation. So long, mister. I’ve ’ad me year—she
can’t tike that away from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she was gone. He watched her from
the window walking along the pavement, with
the feathers nodding at every step. Once she
stopped and looked back—and the feathers
seemed to wilt and die. Then she went on
again—and this time she didn’t stop. She’d
“ ’ad ’er year,” had Lizzie; maybe the remembrance
of it helped her gallant little soul when
she returned the barrel-organ—the useless barrel-organ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this was your present, Jimmy.” Molly
was speaking just behind him, and her eyes were
very bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Molly,” he smiled. “Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand what’s happened,” she
said slowly. “I don’t understand anything
except the one big fact that Peter has come
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that enough?” he asked gently.
“Isn’t that enough, my dear? Peter’s come
back—funny old Peter. The rest will keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he took her left hand and drew
off the engagement ring he had given her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on that finger now—Molly; though I’d
like you to keep it now if you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while she stared at him wonderingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy, but you’re big!” she whispered
at length. “I’m so sorry!” She turned away
as Peter’s voice, weak and tremulous, came from
the other room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in with me, old man,” she said. “Come
in and talk to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jimmy shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t want me, dear; I’m just—just
going out for a bit——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly he left the room—they didn’t want
him: any more than they wanted Lizzie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only she had had her year.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“My</span> dear Cynthia, you haven’t seen our Hermit
yet. He’s quite the show exhibit of the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Cynthia Stockdale yawned and lit a
cigarette. Hermits belonged undoubtedly to the
class of things in which she was <span class='it'>not</span> interested;
the word conjured up a mental picture of a dirty
individual of great piety, clothed in a sack. And
Lady Cynthia loathed dirt and detested piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hermit, Ada!” she remarked, lazily. “I
thought the brand was extinct. Does he feed
ravens and things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be regretted that theological knowledge
was not her strong point, but Ada Laverton, her
hostess, did not smile. From beneath some
marvellously long eyelashes she was watching the
lovely girl lying back in the deck-chair opposite,
who was vainly trying to blow smoke rings. A
sudden wild idea had come into her brain—so wild
as to be almost laughable. But from time
immemorial wild ideas anent their girl friends
have entered the brains of young married women,
especially the lucky ones who have hooked the
right man. And Ada Laverton had undoubtedly
done that. She alternately bullied, cajoled,
and made love to her husband John, in a way
that eminently suited that cheerful and easygoing
gentleman. He adored her quite openly
and ridiculously, and she returned the compliment
just as ridiculously, even if not quite so
openly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Cynthia Stockdale was her best
friend. Before her marriage they had been
inseparable, and perhaps there was no one living
who understood Cynthia as she did. To the
world at large Cynthia was merely a much
photographed and capricious beauty. Worthy
mothers of daughters, who saw her reproduced
weekly in the society papers, sighed inwardly
with envy, and commented on the decadence of
the aristocracy: the daughters tore out the
pictures in a vain endeavour to copy her frocks.
But it wasn’t the frocks that made Cynthia
Stockdale: it was she who made the frocks.
Put her in things selected haphazard from a
jumble sale—put her in remnants discarded by
the people who got it up, and she would still
have seemed the best-dressed woman in the
room. It was a gift she had—not acquired, but
natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Cynthia was twenty-five, and looked
four years younger. Since the war she had been
engaged twice—once to a man in the Blues, and
once to a young and ambitious member of Parliament.
Neither had lasted long, and on the second
occasion people had said unkind things. They
had called her heartless and capricious, and she
had scorned to contradict them. It mattered
nothing to her what people said: if they didn’t
like her they could go away and have nothing
to do with her. And since in her case it wasn’t
a pose, but the literal truth, people did not go
away. Only to Ada Laverton did she give her
real confidence: only to Ada Laverton did she
show the real soul that lay below the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying,” she had said, lying in that same
chair a year previously, “I’m trying to find the
real thing. I needn’t marry if I don’t want to;
I haven’t got to marry for a home and a roof.
And it’s got to be the right man. Of course I
may make a mistake—a mistake which I shan’t
find out till it’s too late. But surely when one
has found it out before it’s too late, it’s better to
acknowledge it at once. It’s no good making a
second worse one by going through with it. I
thought Arthur was all right”—Arthur was the
member of Parliament—“I’m awfully fond of
Arthur still. But I’m not the right wife for him.
We jarred on one another in a hundred little
ways. And he hasn’t got a sense of humour.
I shall never forget the shock I got when I first
realised that. He seemed to think that a sense of
humour consisted of laughing at humorous things,
of seeing a jest as well as anyone else. He
didn’t seem to understand me when I told him
that the real sense of humour is often closer to
tears than laughter. Besides”—she had added
inconsequently—“he had a dreadful trick of
whistling down my neck when we danced. No
woman can be expected to marry a permanent
draught. And as for poor old Bill—well Bill’s
an angel. I still adore Bill. He is, I think,
the most supremely handsome being I’ve ever
seen in my life—especially when he’s got his full
dress on. But, my dear, I blame myself over Bill.
I ought to have known it before I got engaged to
him; as a matter of fact I did know it. Bill is,
without exception, the biggest fool in London. I
thought his face might atone for his lack of brains;
I thought that perhaps if I took him in hand he
might do something in the House of Lords—his
old father can’t live much longer—but I gave it
up. He is simply incapable of any coherent
thought at all. He can’t spell; he can’t add, and
once when I asked him if he liked Rachmaninoff,
he thought it was the man who had built the
Pyramids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This and much more came back to Ada
Laverton as she turned over in her mind the
sudden wild idea that had come to her. Above
all things she wanted to see Cynthia married;
she was so utterly happy herself that she longed
for her friend to share it too. She knew, as no
one else did, what a wonderful wife and pal
Cynthia would make to the right man. But it
must be the right man; it must be the real thing.
And like a blinding flash had come the thought of
the Hermit—the Hermit who had come into the
neighbourhood six months previously, and taken
the little farm standing in the hollow overlooking
the sea. For, as she frequently told John, if it
hadn’t been for the fact that she was tied to a
silly old idiot of a husband, she’d have married the
Hermit herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he doesn’t feed ravens,” she remarked
at length. “Only puppies. He breeds Cairns
and Aberdeens. We’ll stroll up and see him
after tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hermit breeding dogs!” Cynthia sat up
lazily. “My dear, you intrigue me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! he’s not a bad young man,” said Ada
Laverton, indifferently. “Quite passable looking,
D.S.O. and M.C. and that sort of thing. Been
all over the world, and is really quite interesting
when you can get him to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of age?” asked her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty to thirty-five. You shall see him.
But you’re not to go and turn his head; he’s very
peaceful and happy as he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Cynthia smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think hermits are much in my line.
A man’s job is to be up and doing; not to bury
himself alive and breed dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell him so,” said her hostess. “It will
do him good.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>An excited rush of puppies—fat, bouncing,
lolloping puppies; a stern order: “Heel, you
young blighters, heel!” in a pleasant, cheerful
voice; a laughing greeting from Ada Laverton,
and Lady Cynthia Stockdale found herself shaking
hands with the Hermit. She shook hands
as a man shakes hands, with a firm, steady
grasp, and she looked the person she was greeting
straight in the eyes. To her that first handshake
meant, more often than not, the final
estimate of a stranger’s character; it always
meant the first. And her first estimate of
Desmond Brooke was good. She saw a man of
clear skin and clear eye. He wore no hat, and
his brown hair, curling a little at the temples, was
slightly flecked with grey. His face was bronzed
and a faint smile hovered in the corners of the
eyes that met hers fair and square. His shirt
was open at the neck; the sleeves were rolled up,
showing a pair of muscular brown arms. He was
clean-shaven, and his teeth were very white and
regular. So much, in detail, she noticed during
that first half-second; then she turned her
attention to the puppies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What toppers!” she remarked. “What
absolute toppers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She picked a fat, struggling mixture of legs
and ecstatically slobbering tongue out of the
mêlée at her feet, and the Hermit watched her
gravely. It struck him that in the course of a
fairly crowded life he had never seen a more lovely
picture than the one made by this tall slender girl
with the wriggling puppy in her arms. And
another thing struck him also, though he said
nothing. Possibly it was accidental, but the
puppy she had picked up, and which was now
making frantic endeavours to lick her face, was
out and away the best of the litter. Almost
angrily he told himself that it <span class='it'>was</span> an accident,
and yet he could not quite banish the thought
that it was an accident which would happen
every time. Thoroughbred picks thoroughbred;
instinctively the girl would pick the best. His
mouth set a little, giving him a look of sternness,
and at that moment their eyes met over the
puppy’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he for sale?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undoubtedly he was for sale; Desmond
Brooke, though he was in no need of money, did
not believe in running anything save on business
lines. But now something that he did not stop to
analyse made him hesitate. He felt a sudden
inconsequent distaste against selling the puppy
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve picked the best, I see,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she answered, with the faintest
trace of hauteur. Insensibly she felt that this
man was hostile to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that that one is not for sale,”
he continued. “You can have any of the
others if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly she restored the puppy to its mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having chosen the best, Mr. Brooke,” she
said, looking him straight in the face, “I don’t
care about taking anything second-rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a second or two they stared at one
another. Ada Laverton had wandered away and
was talking shop to the gardener; the Hermit
and Lady Cynthia were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surprise me,” said the Hermit, calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is gratuitously rude,” answered the girl
quietly. “It is also extremely impertinent.
And lastly it shows that you are a very bad judge
of character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sincerely hope that your ‘lastly’ is true.
Am I to understand, then, that you do not care
to buy one of the other puppies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly the girl laughed half-angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by daring to say such a
thing to me? Why, you haven’t known me for
more than two minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not strictly true, Lady Cynthia.
Anyone who is capable of reading and takes in
the illustrated papers can claim your acquaintance
weekly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” she answered. “You disapprove of
my poor features being reproduced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Personally not at all,” he replied. “I know
enough of the world, and am sufficiently broadminded,
I trust, to realise how completely
unimportant the matter is. Lady Cynthia
Stockdale at Ascot, at Goodwood, in her motor-car,
out of her motor-car, by the fire, by the
gas stove, in her boudoir, out of her boudoir,
in the garden, not in the garden—and always in a
different frock every time. It doesn’t matter to
me, but there are some people who haven’t got
enough money to pay for the doctor’s bill when
their wives are dying. And it’s such a comfort
to them to see you by the fire. To know that
half the money you paid for your frock would
save the life of the woman they love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re talking like a ranting tub-thumper,”
she cried, furiously. “How dare you say such
things to me? And, anyway, does breeding dogs
in the wilderness help them with their doctors’
bills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Touché</span>,” said the man, with a faint smile.
“Perhaps I haven’t expressed myself very
clearly. You can’t pay the bills, Lady Cynthia—I
can’t. There are too many thousands to pay.
But it’s the bitter contrast that hits them, and
it’s all so petty.” For a while he paused, seeming
to seek for his words. “Come with me, Lady
Cynthia, and I’ll show you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost violently he swung round on his heel
and strode off towards the house. For a moment
she hesitated, then she followed him slowly.
Anger and indignation were seething in her mind;
the monstrous impertinence of this complete
stranger was almost bewildering. She found
him standing in his smoking-room unlocking a
drawer in a big writing-desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said uncompromisingly from the
doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have something to show you,” he remarked
quietly. “But before I show it to you, I want
to tell you a very short story. Three years ago
I was in the back of beyond in Brazil. I’d got a
bad dose of fever, and the gassing I got in France
wasn’t helping matters. It was touch and go
whether I pulled through or not. And one day
one of the fellows got a two-month-old <span class='it'>Tatler</span>.
In that <span class='it'>Tatler</span> was a picture—a picture of the
loveliest girl I have ever seen. I tore it out, and
I propped it up at the foot of my bed. I think
I worshipped it; I certainly fell in love with it.
There is the picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed it to her, and she looked at it in
silence. It was of herself, and after a moment or
two she raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” she said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few months ago I came back to England.
I found a seething cauldron of discontent; men
out of work—strikes—talk of revolution. And
this was the country for which a million of our
best had died. I also found—week after week—my
picture girl displayed in every paper, as if no
such thing as trouble existed. She, in her motor-car,
cared for none of these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unjust,” said the girl, and her voice
was low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew it was unjust,” answered the man,
“but I couldn’t help it. And if I couldn’t help
it—I who loved her—what of these others? It
seemed symbolical to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nero fiddling,” said the girl, with a faint
smile. “You’re rather a strange person, Mr.
Brooke. Am I to understand that you’re in love
with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not. I’m in love with the you of
that picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. You have set up an image. And
supposing that image is a true one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need we discuss that?” said the man, with
faint sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The supposition is at least as possible as that
you are doing any vast amount of good for the
seething cauldron of discontent, I think you called
it, by breeding Aberdeens in the country. I’m
afraid you’re a crank, Mr. Brooke, and not a very
consistent one at that. And a crank is to my
mind synonymous with a bore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man replaced the picture in his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then perhaps we had better join Mrs.
Laverton,” he remarked. “I apologise for
having wearied you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence they went out into the garden, to
find Ada Laverton wandering aimlessly round
looking for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you two been?” she demanded,
as she saw them approaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brooke has been showing me a relic
of his past,” said Lady Cynthia. “Most interesting
and touching. Are you ready to go,
Ada?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Laverton gave a quick glance at their
two faces, and wondered what had happened.
Not much, surely, in so short a time—and yet
with Cynthia you never could tell. The Hermit’s
face, usually so inscrutable, showed traces of
suppressed feeling; Cynthia’s was rather too
expressionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you coming to the ball to-morrow night,
Hermit?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know there was one on, Mrs. Laverton,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cricket ball, my good man,” she
exclaimed. “It’s been advertised for the last
month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely Mr. Brooke doesn’t countenance
anything so frivolous as dancing?” remarked
Lady Cynthia. “After the lecture he has just
given me on my personal deportment the idea
is out of the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless I propose to come, Lady
Cynthia,” said Brooke quietly. “You must
forgive me if I have allowed my feelings to run
away with me to-day. And perhaps to-morrow
you will allow me to find out if the new image is
correct—or a pose also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked the girl,
puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lady Cynthia Stockdale—possibly the best
dancer in London,’ ” he quoted mockingly;
“I forget which of the many papers I saw
it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you propose to pass judgment on my
dancing?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will be good enough to give me a
dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment words failed her. The cool,
the sublime impertinence of this man literally
choked her. Then she nodded briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you a dance if you’re there in time.
And then you can test for yourself, if you’re
capable of testing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed without a word, and stood watching
them as they walked down the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, Ada, that he’s the most detestable
man I’ve ever met,” remarked Lady Cynthia
furiously, as they turned into the main road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Ada Laverton said nothing, but wondered
the more.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>She saw him as soon as she got into the ballroom.
It was the last day but one of the local
cricket week, and the room was crowded. A large
number of the men she knew—men she had
danced with in London who had come down to
play—and within half a minute she was surrounded.
It was a chance of getting a dance
with her which was not to be missed; in London
she generally danced with one or at the most two
men for the whole evening—men who were
absolutely perfect performers. For dancing was
a part of Lady Cynthia’s life—and a big part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The humour of the situation had struck her
that day. For this dog-breeding crank to
presume to judge her powers of dancing seemed
too sublimely funny for annoyance. But he
deserved to be taught a very considerable lesson.
And she proposed to teach him. After that she
proposed to dismiss him completely from her
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a cool nod as he came up, and
frowned slightly as she noticed the faint glint of
laughter in his eyes. Really Mr. Desmond
Brooke was a little above himself. So much the
worse for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether you’ll find one or
not,” she remarked carelessly, handing him her
programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at it without a word, and quietly
erased someone’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve made special arrangements with the
band for Number 9, Lady Cynthia,” he remarked
coolly. “A lot of people will be in at supper
then, so we ought to have the floor more to
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant he had bowed and disappeared,
leaving her staring speechlessly at her
programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A breezy customer,” murmured a man beside
her. “Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gentleman who is going to have the biggest
lesson of his life,” she answered ominously, and
the man laughed. He knew Lady Cynthia—and
he knew Lady Cynthia’s temper when it was
roused. But for once he was wrong in his
diagnosis; the outward and visible were there all
right—the inward and mental state of affairs in
keeping with them was not. For the first time in
her life Lady Cynthia felt at a loss. Her partners
found her <span class='it'>distraite</span> and silent; as a matter of
fact she was barely conscious of their existence.
And the more she lashed at herself mentally,
the more confused did she get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was preposterous, impossible. Why should
she cut Tubby Dawlish to dance with a crank who
kept dogs? A crank, moreover, who openly
avowed that his object was to see if she could
dance. Every now and then she saw him lounging
by the door watching her. She knew he was
watching her, though she gave no sign of being
aware of his existence. And all the while
Number 9 grew inexorably nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dance indeed! She would show him how she
could dance. And as a result she fell into the
deadly fault of trying. No perfect dancer ever
<span class='it'>tries</span> to dance; they just dance. And Lady
Cynthia knew that better than most people.
Which made her fury rise still more against the
man standing just outside the door smoking a
cigarette. A thousand times—no; she would
not cut Tubby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she realised that people were moving
in to supper; that the 8 was being taken down
from the band platform—that 9 was being
put up. And she realised that Desmond Brooke
the Hermit was crossing the room towards
her; was standing by her side while Tubby—like
an outraged terrier—was glaring at him
across her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is mine, old thing,” spluttered Tubby.
“Number 9.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” said the Hermit quietly. “I
fixed Number 9 especially with Lady Cynthia
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated—and was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Tubby,” she said a little weakly.
“I forgot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a trace of triumph showed on the Hermit’s
face, as he gravely watched the indignant back
of his rival retreating towards the door: not a
trace of expression showed on his face as he turned
to the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been trying to-night, Lady Cynthia,”
he said gravely. “Please don’t—this time.
It’s a wonderful tune this—half waltz, half tango.
It was lucky finding Lopez conducting: he has
played for me before. And I want you just to
forget everything except the smell of the passion
flowers coming in through the open windows,
and the thrumming of the guitars played by the
natives under the palm-trees.” His eyes were
looking into hers, and suddenly she drew a deep
breath. Things had got beyond her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was marked as a fox-trot on the programme,
and several of the more enthusiastic performers
were waiting to get off on the stroke of time.
But as the first haunting notes of the dance
wailed out—they paused and hesitated. This
was no fox-trot; this was—but what matter
what it was? For after the first bar no one
moved in the room: they stood motionless
watching one couple—Lady Cynthia Stockdale
and an unknown man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s the fellow who breeds dogs,”
muttered someone to his partner, but there was
no reply. She was too engrossed in watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as for Lady Cynthia, from the moment she
felt Desmond Brooke’s arm round her, the world
had become merely movement—such movement
as she had never thought of before. To say that
he was a perfect dancer would be idle: he was
dancing itself. And the band, playing as men
possessed, played for them and them only.
Everything was forgotten: nothing in the world
mattered save that they should go on and on and
on—dancing. She was utterly unconscious of
the crowd of onlookers: she didn’t know that
people had left the supper-room and were
thronging in at the door: she knew nothing save
that she had never danced before. Dimly she
realised at last that the music had stopped:
dimly she heard a great roar of applause—but
only dimly. It seemed to come from far away—the
shouts of “Encore” seemed hazy and dream-like.
They had left the ballroom, though she
was hardly conscious of where he was taking her,
and when he turned to her and said, “Get a wrap
or something: I want to talk to you out in
God’s fresh air,” she obeyed him without a word.
He was waiting for her when she returned,
standing motionless where she had left him. And
still in silence he led the way to his car which had
been left apart from all the others, almost as if
he had expected to want it before the end. For
a moment she hesitated, for Lady Cynthia,
though utterly unconventional, was no fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come with me?” he said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to the cliffs beyond my house. It will
take ten minutes—and I want to talk to you with
the sound of the sea below us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had the car in readiness?” she said
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For both of us—or for me alone,” he
answered. “If you won’t come, then I go
home. Will you come with me?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I will come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped her into the car and wrapped a rug
round her; then he climbed in beside her. And
as they swung out of the little square, the strains
of the next dance followed them from the open
windows of the Town Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drove as he danced—perfectly; and in the
dim light the girl watched his clear-cut profile
as he stared ahead into the glare of the headlights.
Away to the right his farm flashed by,
the last house before they reached the top of the
cliffs. And gradually, above the thrumming of
the engine, she heard the lazy boom of the big
Atlantic swell on the rocks ahead. At last he
stopped where the road ran parallel to the top of
the cliff, and switched off the lights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said, a little mockingly, “is the
new image correct or a pose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dance divinely,” he answered gravely.
“More divinely than any woman I have ever
danced with, and I have danced with those who
are reputed to be the show dancers of the world.
But I didn’t ask you to come here to talk about
dancing; I asked you to come here in order that
I might first apologise, and then say Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl gave a little start, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I talked a good deal of rot to you yesterday,”
he went on, after a moment. “You were
justified in calling me a ranting tub-thumper.
But I was angry with myself, and when one is
angry with oneself one does foolish things. I
know as well as you do just how little society
photographs mean: that was only a peg to hang
my inexcusable tirade on. You see, when one
has fallen in love with an ideal—as I fell in love
with that picture of you, all in white in the garden
at your father’s place—and you treasure that
ideal for three years, it jolts one to find that the
ideal is different to what you thought. I fell
in love with a girl in white, and sometimes in the
wilds I’ve seen visions and dreamed dreams.
And then I found her a lovely being in Paquin’s
most expensive frocks; a social celebrity: a
household name. And then I met her, and knew
my girl in white had gone. What matter that
it was the inexorable rule of Nature that she
must go: what matter that she had changed
into an incredibly lovely woman? She had
gone: my dream girl had vanished. In her place
stood Lady Cynthia Stockdale—the well-known
society beauty. Reality had come—and I was
angry with you for having killed my dream—angry
with myself for having to wake up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is my apology,” he continued gravely.
“Perhaps you will understand: I think you
will understand. And just because I was angry
with you, I made you dance with me to-night. I
said to myself: ‘I will show Lady Cynthia
Stockdale that the man who loved the girl in
white can meet her successor on her own ground.’
That’s the idea I started with, but things went
wrong half-way through the dance. The anger
died; in its place there came something else.
Even my love for the girl in white seemed to
become a bit hazy; I found that the successor
had supplanted her more completely than I
realised. And since the successor has the world
at her feet—why, the breeder of dogs will efface
himself, for his own peace of mind. So, good-bye,
Lady Cynthia—and the very best of luck. If it
won’t bore you I may say that I’m not really a
breeder of dogs by profession. This is just an
interlude; a bit of rest spent with the most
wonderful pals in the world. I’m getting back
to harness soon: voluntary harness, I’m glad to
say, as the shekels don’t matter. But anything
one can do towards greasing the wheels, and
helping those priceless fellows who gave everything
without a murmur during the war, and
who are up against it now—is worth doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still she said nothing, while he backed the
car on to the grass beside the road, and turned
it the way they had come. A jumble of strange
thoughts were in her mind; a jumble out of
which there stuck one dominant thing—the
brown tanned face of the man beside her. And
when he stopped the car by his own farm and
left her without a word of apology, she sat quite
motionless staring at the white streak of road in
front. At last she heard his footsteps coming
back along the drive, and suddenly a warm
wriggling bundle was placed in her lap—a bundle
which slobbered joyfully and then fell on the
floor with an indignant yelp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The puppy,” he said quietly. “Please take
him.” And very softly under his breath he
added: “The best to the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she heard him, and even as she stooped
to lift the puppy on to her knees, her heart began
to beat madly. She knew: at last, she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take you back to the dance,” he was
saying, “and afterwards I’ll deposit that young
rascal at Mrs. Laverton’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then for the first time she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please go to Ada’s house first. Afterwards
we’ll see about the dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed and swung the car left-handed
through the lodge gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you wait for me?” she said, as he
pulled up at the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as you like,” he answered courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I may be some time,” she continued
a little unevenly. “And don’t wait for me
here: wait for me where the drive runs through
that little copse, half-way down to the lodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant she had disappeared into the
house, with the puppy in her arms. Why by
the little copse? wondered the man as he slowly
drove the car down the drive. The butler had
seen them already, so what did it matter? He
pulled up the car in the shadow of a big oak tree,
and lit a cigarette. Then, with his arms resting
on the steering wheel, he sat staring in front of
him. He had done a mad thing, and she’d taken
it wonderfully well. He always had done mad
things all his life; he was made that way. But
this was the maddest he had ever done. With a
grim smile he pictured her infuriated partners,
waiting in serried rows by the door, cursing him
by all their gods. And then the smile faded, and
he sighed, while his knuckles gleamed white on
the wheel. If only she wasn’t so gloriously
pretty; if only she wasn’t so utterly alive and
wonderful. Well—it was the penalty of playing
with fire; and it had been worth it. Yes; it
had been worth it—even if the wound never
quite healed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A fool there was, and he made his prayer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pitched his cigarette away, and suddenly
he stiffened and sat motionless, while something
seemed to rise in his throat and choke him, and
the blood hammered hotly at his temples. A
girl in white was standing not five feet from him
on the fringe of the little wood: a girl holding a
puppy in her arms. And then he heard her
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not the same frock—but it’s the nearest
I can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came up to the car, and once again over
the head of the puppy their eyes met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking,” she said steadily, “for
the real thing. I don’t <span class='it'>think</span> I’ve found it—I
<span class='it'>know</span> I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!” he stammered hoarsely. “Oh!
my dear dream girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me back to the cliff, Desmond,” she
whispered. “Take me back to our cliff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And an outraged puppy, bouncing off the
running-board on to a stray fir-cone, viewed the
proceedings of the next five minutes with silent
displeasure.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“It’s</span> as easy as shelling peas to be a detective
in fiction,” grunted the Barrister. “He’s
merely the author of the yarn disguised as a
character, and he knows the solution before he
starts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the reader doesn’t, if the story is told
well,” objected the Doctor. “And that’s all
that matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I grant you that,” said the Barrister,
lighting a cigar. “I’m not inveighing against
the detective story—I love ’em. All I’m saying
is that in life a detective’s job is a very different
matter to—well, take the illustrious example—to
that of Sherlock Holmes. He’s got to make
the crime fit to the clues, not the clues fit into
the crime. It’s not so terribly difficult to reconstruct
the murder of the Prime Minister from a
piece of charred paper discovered in the railway
refreshment-room at Bath—in fiction; it’s
altogether a different matter in reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soldier thoughtfully filled his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet there have been many cases when
the reconstruction has been made on some clue
almost equally ‘flimsy,’ ” he murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few,” conceded the Barrister. “But nine
out of ten are built up with laborious care. The
structure does not rest on any one fact—but on
a whole lot of apparently unimportant and trivial
ones. Of course it’s more spectacular to bring
a man to the gallows because half a brick was
found lying on the front door-step, but in practice
it doesn’t happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does—sometimes,” remarked a quiet,
sandy-haired man who was helping himself to a
whisky-and-soda. “It does sometimes, you
man of law. Your remarks coupled with my
present occupation remind me of just such a
case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your present occupation appears to be
drinking whisky,” said the Doctor, curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely,” returned the other. “Almost as
prosaic a thing as our legal luminary’s half-brick.”
He settled himself comfortably in a
chair, and the others leaned forward expectantly.
“And yet on that very ordinary pastime hinged
an extremely interesting case: one in which I
was lucky enough to play a principal part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night is yet young, old man,” said the
Barrister. “It’s up to you to prove your words,
and duly confound me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandy-haired man took a sip of his drink:
then he put the glass on the table beside him and
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if it won’t bore you, I’m agreeable.
I’ll tell you the whole thing exactly as it took
place, only altering the names of the people
involved. It happened before the war—in that
hot summer of 1911, to be exact. I’d been working
pretty hard in London, and about the end of
July I got an invitation to go down and stop with
some people in Devonshire. I will call them the
Marleys, and they lived just outside a small
village on the north coast. The family consisted
of old Marley, who was a man rising sixty, and
his two daughters, Joan and Hilda. There was
also Jack Fairfax, through whom, as a matter of
fact, I had first got to know them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack was about my own age—thirty odd,
and we’d been up at Cambridge together. He
was no relation to old Marley, but he was an
orphan, and Marley was his guardian, or had been
when Jack was a youngster. And from the very
first Jack and the old man had not got on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marley was not everybody’s meat, by a
long way—rather a queer-tempered, secretive
blighter; and Jack Fairfax had the devil of a
temper at times. When he was a boy he had no
alternative except to do as his guardian told him,
but even in those early days, as I gathered subsequently,
there had been frequent storms. And
when he came down from Cambridge there were
two or three most unholy rows which culminated
in Jack leaving the house for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was apparently this severance from the two
girls, whom he had more or less regarded as
sisters, which caused the next bust-up. And
this one, according to Jack, was in the nature of
a volcanic eruption. The two girls had come up
to London to go through the season with some
aunt, and Jack had seen a good deal of them
with the net result that he and Joan had fallen
in love with each other. Then the fat was in
the fire. Jack straightway had gone down to
Devonshire to ask old Marley’s consent: old
Marley had replied in terms which, judging from
Jack’s account of the interview, had contained a
positive profusion of un-Parliamentary epithets.
Jack had lost his temper properly—and, well,
you know, the usual thing. At any rate, the
long and the short of it was that old Marley had
recalled both his daughters from London, and
had sworn that if he ever saw Jack near the
house again he’d pepper him with a shot-gun.
To which Jack had replied that only his grey
hairs and his gout saved Mr. Marley from the
biggest hiding he’d ever had in his life—even if
not the biggest he deserved. With which genial
exchange of playful badinage I gathered the
interview ended. And that was how matters
stood when I went down in July, 1911.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For some peculiar reason the old man liked
me, even though I was a friend of Jack’s. And in
many ways I quite liked him, though there was
always something about him which defeated me.
Of course, he had a foul temper—but it wasn’t
altogether that. He seemed to me at times to
be in fear of something or somebody; and yet,
though I say that now, I don’t know that I went
as far as thinking so at the time. It was an
almost indefinable impression—vague and yet
very real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The two girls were perfectly charming,
though they were both a little afraid of their
father. How long it would have taken Joan to
overcome this timidity, and go to Jack without
her father’s consent, I don’t know. And incidentally,
as our legislators say, the question did
not arise. Fate held the ace of trumps, and proceeded
to deal it during my visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandy-haired man leant back in his
chair and crossed his legs deliberately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it was about the fourth day after I
arrived (he went on, after a while) that the
tragedy happened. We were sitting in the
drawing-room after dinner—a couple of men
whose names I forget, and a girl friend of Hilda’s.
Hilda herself was there, and Joan, who seemed
very preoccupied, had come in about a quarter
of an hour previously. I had noticed that Hilda
had looked at her sister inquiringly as she
entered, and that Joan had shrugged her
shoulders. But nothing had been said, and
naturally I asked no questions with the others
there, though from the air of suppressed excitement
on Joan’s face I knew there was something
in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Marley himself was not with us: he was
in his study at the other end of the house. The
fact was not at all unusual: he frequently retired
to his own den after dinner, sometimes joining
the rest of the party for a few minutes before going
to bed, more often not appearing again till the
following morning. And so we all sat there
talking idly, with the windows wide open and the
light shining out on to the lawn. It must have
been somewhere about ten to a quarter past
when suddenly Hilda gave a little scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you want?’ she cried. ‘Who
are you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swung round in my chair, to find a man
standing on the lawn outside, in the centre of the
light. He was facing us, and as we stared at
him he came nearer till he was almost in the
room. And the first thing that struck me was
that he looked a little agitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You will excuse me appearing like this,’ he
said, ‘but——’ He broke off and looked at me.
‘Might I have a word with you alone, sir?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I glanced at the others: obviously he was a
stranger. No trace of recognition appeared on
anyone’s face, and I began to feel a little suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What is it?’ I cried. ‘What can you
possibly want to speak to me about that you
can’t say now?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shrugged his shoulders slightly. ‘As you
will,’ he answered. ‘My idea was to avoid
frightening the ladies. In the room at the other
end of the house a man has been murdered.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment everyone was too thunderstruck
to reply; then Hilda gave a choking cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What sort of a man?’ she said, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘An elderly man of, I should think, about
sixty,’ returned the other, gravely, and Hilda
buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I will come with, you at once, sir,’ I said,
hurriedly, and the two other men rose. Instinctively,
I think, we all knew it must be old
Marley: there was no one else it could be. But
the sudden shock of it had dazed us all. I
glanced at Joan. She was staring at the man
like a girl bereft of her senses, and I put my hand
reassuringly on her shoulder. And then she
looked up at me, and the expression in her eyes
pulled me together. It was like a cold douche,
and it acted instantaneously. Because it wasn’t
horror or dazed stupefaction that I read on her
face: it was terror—agonised terror. And
suddenly I remembered her air of suppressed
excitement earlier in the evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again the sandy-haired man paused
while the others waited in silence for him to
continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was old Marley right enough (he went on
quietly). We walked round the front of the
house until we came to the window of his study,
and there instinctively we paused. The window
was open, and he was sitting at his desk quite
motionless. His head had fallen forward, and
on his face was a look of dreadful fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a while none of us moved. Then, with
an effort, I threw my leg over the window-sill
and entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He’s quite dead,’ I said, and I felt my voice
was shaking. ‘We’d better send for the police.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others nodded, and in silence I picked
up the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Marley’s been killed,’ I heard myself
saying. ‘Will you send someone up at once?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then for the first time I noticed the
poker lying beside the chair, and saw the back
of the old man’s head. It wasn’t a pretty sight,
and one of the other men staying in the house—a
youngster—turned very white, and went to the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pretty obvious how it was done,’ said the
stranger, quietly. ‘Well, gentlemen, nothing
ought to be touched in this room until the police
arrive. I suggest that we should draw the
curtains and go somewhere else to wait for
them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think any of us were sorry to fall in
with his suggestion. I also don’t think I’ve ever
drunk such a large whisky-and-soda as I did a
few minutes later. Discovering the body had
been bad enough: breaking the news to the two
girls was going to be worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Joan who met me in the hall—and we
stared at one another in silence. Then I nodded
my head stupidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s father,’ she whispered. ‘Oh, my
God!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put out my hand to steady her, and she was
looking at me with a fixed stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t you understand?’ she muttered,
hoarsely, and swallowing all the time. ‘Don’t
you understand? Jack has been here to-night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jack!’ I looked at her foolishly. ‘Jack!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then her full meaning struck me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How did that man find out?’ she whispered.
‘And who is he?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know. I’ll go and ask him.’ I was
still trying to adjust this new development—and
her next words seemed to come from a great
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do something. For God’s sake—do something.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she turned and left me, and I watched
her go up the stairs, walking stiffly and clinging
to the banisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Jack had been there! And old Marley
was dead! Murdered! Hit on the head with
a poker. And Jack had been there. It’s only
in romantic fiction that the reader is expected to
assume the impossibility of the hero committing
a crime, owing to the extreme beauty of his
nature. And this wasn’t romantic fiction. It
was hard, brutal reality. The two facts stood
there, side by side, in all their dazzling simplicity.
Jack’s nature was not supremely beautiful. He
was an ordinary man, with the devil of a temper
when it was roused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mechanically I started to walk back to the
room where I had left the other three men.
They were sitting in silence when I entered, and
after a while the stranger got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A dreadful thing to happen,’ he said,
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘May I ask, sir,’ I began, ‘how you came to
discover it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Very simply,’ he answered. ‘I was strolling
along the road, going back to the village inn
where I have been stopping for two or three
nights, when I saw the window of the room
through the trees. The light was shining out,
and I could see someone sitting at the desk.
More out of idle curiosity than anything else, I
paused for a moment or two, and then something
began to arouse my suspicions. The man at the
desk seemed so motionless. I thought perhaps
he had fainted, or was ill, and after a little hesitation
I went in at the gate and looked through
the window. To my horror I saw he was dead—and
I at once came round to the other room
from which the light was shining, and where I
found you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There is a point which may have some
bearing on the crime,’ he continued, after a pause.
‘On my way up from the inn a man passed me.
He was coming from this direction, and seemed to
me to be in a very excited condition. It was his
obvious agitation that made me notice him at the
time, though in the dim light I couldn’t see his
face very clearly. But he was swinging his stick
in the air, and muttering to himself. At the
moment I didn’t think much about it. But
now——’ He shrugged his shoulders slightly.
‘Of course, I may be completely wrong, but I
think it is a thing worth mentioning to the police.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Would you know the man again?’ I asked,
trying to speak quite normally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, he was tall—six feet at least—and
broad. And he was clean-shaven.’ He spoke
thoughtfully, weighing his words. ‘I might
know him again—but I wouldn’t swear to it.
One has to be doubly careful if a man’s life is at
stake.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I turned away abruptly. Jack was tall and
broad and clean-shaven. Strive as I would, the
deadly suspicion was beginning to grip me that
Jack, in a fit of ungovernable passion, had killed
the old man. And at such moments, whatever
may be the legal aspect of the matter, one’s main
idea is how best to help a pal. If Jack had indeed
done it, what was the best thing to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rang the bell, and told the scared-looking
maid to bring the whisky and some glasses. Then,
with a muttered apology, I left the room. I felt
I wanted to talk to Joan about it. I found her
dry-eyed and quite composed, though she was
evidently holding herself under control with a
great effort. And briefly I told her what the
stranger had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She heard me out in silence: then she spoke
with a quiet assurance that surprised me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If Jack did it,’ she said, ‘he doesn’t know
he’s done it. He doesn’t know he’s killed—father.’
She faltered a bit over the last word,
and I didn’t interrupt. ‘What I mean is this,’
she went on after a moment. ‘I know Jack—better
than anyone else. I know those rages of
his—when he sees red. But they’re over in a
minute. He’s capable of anything for a second
or two, but if he’d done it, Hugh, if he’d hit
father—and killed him—his remorse would have
been dreadful. He wouldn’t have run away:
I’m certain of that. That’s why I say that if
Jack did it he doesn’t know—he killed him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said nothing: there was no good telling
her that it wasn’t one blow, nor yet two or three,
that had been used. There was no good telling
her that it was no accidental thing done unwittingly
in the heat of the moment—that it was
an absolute impossibility for the man who had
done it to be in ignorance of the fact. And yet,
though I realised all that, her simple conviction
put new hope into me. Illogical, I admit, but I
went downstairs feeling more confident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found that the local police had arrived—a
sergeant and an ordinary constable—and had
already begun their investigations. The principal
evidence, of course, came from the stranger,
and he repeated to them what he had already
told me. His name apparently was Lenham—Victor
Lenham—and the police knew he had
been stopping at the local inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You saw the body through the window,
sir,’ said the sergeant, ‘and then went round to
the drawing-room?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That is so, sergeant.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You didn’t go into the room?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not until later—with these gentlemen.
You see,’ he added, ‘I’ve seen death too often
not to recognise it. And as, in a way, you will
understand, it was no concern of mine, I thought
it advisable to have some member of the house
itself with me before entering the room.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Quite, sir, quite.’ The sergeant nodded
portentously. ‘Is there anything else you can
tell us?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ said Lenham, ‘there is a point, which
I have already mentioned to this gentleman.’
He glanced at me, and then, turning back to the
sergeant, he told him about the man he had
passed on the road. And it was when he came
to the description that suddenly the constable
gave a whistle of excitement. The sergeant
frowned on him angrily, but the worthy P.C.,
whose only experience of crime up-to-date had
been assisting inebriated villagers home, had
quite lost his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Fairfax, sergeant,’ he exploded. ‘ ’E
was down here to-night. Caught the last train,
’e did. Jenkins at the station told me—sure
thing.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Good heavens, sergeant!’ I said angrily,
‘what the devil is the man talking about? He
surely doesn’t suppose that Mr. Fairfax had
anything to do with it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the mischief was done. The sergeant
formally told off his indiscreet subordinate, but
it was obvious that it was merely an official
rebuke. In a village like that everybody knows
everybody else’s private affairs, and the
strained relations between the dead man and
Jack Fairfax were common property. I could
see at a glance that the sergeant regarded the
matter as solved already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Would you recognise this man again, sir?’
he demanded, and Lenham gave him the same
guarded reply as he had already given to me.
He might—but he wouldn’t swear to it. It was
impossible to be too careful in such a case, he
repeated, and it was practically dark when he
had passed the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all duly noted down, and then we
adjourned to the room of the tragedy. The constable—a
ruddy-faced young man—turned pale
when he saw the body; then he pulled himself
together and assisted the sergeant in his formal
examination. I didn’t blame him—we were all
feeling the strain, somewhat naturally. Lenham
seemed the least concerned, but it wasn’t a
personal matter with him as it was with us,
especially with me. All the time I was fidgeting
round the room, subconsciously watching the
stolid sergeant making notes, but with only one
thought dominating my brain—how best to help
Jack. Not that I had definitely made up my
mind that he’d done it, but even at that stage of
the proceedings I realised that appearances were
against him. And Joan’s words were ringing in
my head—‘For God’s sake—do something.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a while I crossed the room to a small
table on which a tantalus of whisky and two
glasses were standing. I looked at the tray with
unseeing eyes—an Indian silver one, which old
Marley had been very proud of. And then
mechanically I picked up the glasses. I don’t
know why I did so; the action was, as I say,
mechanical. They had been used—both of
them: they had been used for whisky—one
could tell that by the smell. And when I put
the glasses down again on the tray, the sergeant
was approaching with his note-book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandy-haired man paused, with a reminiscent
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever noticed how extraordinarily dense you
can be at times, even with a plain fact staring
you straight in the face? There was one staring
at me for ten minutes that night before my grey
matter began to stir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just hold on a minute,” interrupted the
Barrister. “Is this plain fact staring us in the
face now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t,” conceded the narrator. “At
the moment you are in the position of the other
people in that room. Mind you, I’ve left out
nothing in order to mystify you; the story, as I
have given it to you, is a plain unvarnished
account of what took place. But I’m out to
disprove your half-brick theory, lawyer-man, and
to do so with such little story-telling ability as I
happen to possess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I won’t weary you with what happened
during the next week, beyond saying that an
inquest and a burglary took place. And the
latter, at any rate, was very successful. The
former moved along obvious lines, and resulted
in Jack Fairfax being arrested for the wilful
murder of his guardian, Roger Marley. The
evidence was purely circumstantial, but it was
about as damning as it could be. Jack admitted
to having had an interview with Marley that
night; he admitted that they had had an appalling
quarrel. What was even worse was that he
admitted to having struck the old man in a
furious fit of rage, but beyond that he denied
everything. He absolutely swore that the blow
he struck Marley could not have killed him;
further, that he had never handled the poker.
And then, a finger-print expert proved that he
had. That was the worst shock of the lot, and
his explanation given afterwards that, now he
came to think of it, he had picked up the poker
to ram the tobacco down in his pipe convinced no
one. He indignantly denied that his action in
going up to London by the last train was in any
sense running away; he had intended all along
to go up by that train. And his reason for
leaving the house after the interview without
attempting to see his <span class='it'>fiancée</span> was that he was in
such a rage with her father that he couldn’t
trust himself to speak to her for fear of what he
might say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much for Jack Fairfax’s case—pretty
black, as you will agree. In fact, I don’t
think I should be exaggerating if I said
that there were only two people in England
convinced of his innocence. And he was one
of them. Even Joan’s faith was shaken, a
little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was on the tenth day after the inquest
that I rang up the inspector who had come over
from Exeter to look into the case, with a request
that he would come up to the house. I told him
that I had certain information which might
interest him and suggested that he might care to
hear it. I also rang up Lenham at the inn, and
asked him if he would mind coming along at the
same time. I told him I’d discovered the burglar.
By the way, I didn’t tell you that it was his room
that had been burgled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In about half an hour they arrived, and the
local sergeant as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What’s this about my burglar?’ laughed
Lenham. ‘A funny fellow—because as far as I
can see he didn’t take anything.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘All in good time,’ I answered, smiling.
‘I’ve found out a lot of strange things in
town.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lenham looked at me quickly. ‘Oh! have
you been to London?’ he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ I answered, ‘for two days. Most
entertaining.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the inspector chipped in, impatiently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, sir, what is it you want to say to me?’
He looked at his watch suggestively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘First of all, inspector,’ I said, quietly,
‘I want to ask you a question. Have you ever
heard the legal maxim, <span class='it'>Falsus in uno, falsus
in omne</span>?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could see that he hadn’t the faintest idea
what I was driving at. I could also see that
Lenham’s eyes had suddenly become strained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It means,’ I went on, ‘that if a witness—let
us say—is proved to have told one lie, there is
strong presumptive evidence that he has told
several. At any rate, the value of his statement
is greatly diminished. Do you agree?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Certainly,’ he answered. ‘But I don’t
see——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You will shortly, inspector,’ I remarked.
‘Now who would you consider the principal
witness against Mr. Fairfax?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Mr. Fairfax himself,’ said the inspector,
promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And leaving him out?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well—I suppose—this gentleman here.’
He nodded towards Lenham, who was sitting
quite motionless, watching me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Precisely,’ I murmured. ‘Then why was
it necessary for Mr. Lenham to state that his name
was Lenham, and further to swear that he had
never seen Mr. Marley before—when both those
statements were lies?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What the devil do you mean?’ snarled
Lenham, rising from his chair. ‘What do you
mean by saying my name is not Lenham?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You wanted to know about the burglar
who took nothing, didn’t you?’ I said, grimly.
‘Well—I was the burglar, and I took something
very valuable—an address.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What on earth——’ began the inspector,
and then he glanced at Lenham. ‘I think you’d
better sit still, Mr. Lenham,’ he said, quietly,
‘until we have heard what this gentleman has to
say.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lenham sat back in his chair with a venomous
look at me. Then he laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘By all means, inspector,’ he remarked.
‘Only it is a little disconcerting to be cross-examined
suddenly by a man who admits he is a
thief.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a matter of fact the man didn’t know how
much I knew—or how little; and between ourselves
it was deuced little. But, watching him
closely, I knew I was right, and my only hope was
to bluff him into some admission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Shall we endeavour to reconstruct the events
of the night when Mr. Marley was murdered, Mr.
Lenardi?’ I began, quietly. ‘That is your
name, is it not?—and you are a Corsican.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ he said, ‘what if I am? I had a
very good reason for changing my name.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Doubtless,’ I agreed. ‘Let us hope your
reason will prove satisfactory to the inspector.
May I suggest, however, unless you can supply a
better one, that your reason was to avoid the
notoriety which would inevitably arise if a
foreigner came to stay in a small village like
this? And you were particularly anxious to
avoid any possibility of Mr. Marley knowing that
a Corsican was in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He laughed sarcastically. ‘I think that
I have already stated that I have never even seen
Mr. Marley,’ he sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh!’ I remarked. ‘Then might I ask you,
inspector, to have a look at this photograph?
It is old and faded, but the faces are still clear.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I handed the photograph to the inspector,
and with a sudden curse the Corsican whipped
out a knife and sprang at me. He realised even
then that the game was up, and his one thought
was to revenge himself on me. But I’d been
expecting some such move, and I’d got a revolver
handy. Incidentally, revolver shooting is one
of the few things I can do, and I plugged him
through the forearm before he could do any
damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stood there glaring at me sullenly, and
then the inspector took a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Stand by that window, sergeant. Now,
Mr. whatever-your-name-is, no monkey tricks.
Do you still deny that you knew Mr. Marley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I refuse to answer,’ snarled the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Because this photograph is of you and
Marley and a woman. Taken abroad somewhere.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Naples, to be exact, inspector,’ I said.
‘I found it in his rooms in Berners Street, the
address of which I got as the result of my
burglary here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Corsican stood there like a beast at
bay, and the inspector’s face was stern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What explanation have you got to give?’
he rapped out. ‘Why did you lie in evidence?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I refuse to answer,’ repeated the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Since he is so uncommunicative,’ I remarked,
‘perhaps you will allow me to reconstruct
the crime. Much of it, of necessity, is
guess-work. For instance, Lenardi, what was
your motive in murdering Mr. Marley?’ I
rapped the question out at him, and though he’d
have killed me willingly if he could have got at
me he didn’t deny it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ I continued, ‘it doesn’t matter.
Let us assume it was the girl in that photograph.
You tracked Marley to earth here—in this
village—that is all that concerns us. And having
tracked him, you bided your time. Vengeance
is the sweeter for delay. Each evening you
walked up here, watching him through the
window—gloating over what was to come. And
then one night you found another man with him—Jack
Fairfax—and they were quarrelling. At
once you saw that this was your opportunity.
However skilfully you hid your traces under
ordinary circumstances, there was always a grave
risk; but here, ready to hand, was a marvellous
stroke of luck. Perhaps you crept nearer the
window in the darkness, secure in the fact that
the room was in a remote part of the house.
You saw Jack Fairfax leave, blind with rage, and
then, skulking out of the night, you entered the
room yourself.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s a lie!’ shouted the Corsican, but his
lips were white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And then old Marley saw you, and the rage
on his face was replaced by a dreadful terror.
He knew what you had come for. I don’t think
you wasted much time, Lenardi. You picked up
the poker with a gloved hand—oh! you were
taking no chances—and you battered his head in.
And then, Lenardi—and then you drank a
whisky-and-soda. You drank a whisky-and-soda,
and then you decided on a very bold move:
you came and alarmed the rest of the house. It
was clever of you, but——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandy-haired man smiled thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sprang forward together—the inspector
and I; but we were too late. The Corsican had
swallowed poison before we could stop him. He
was dead in half a minute and he never spoke
again. So I can only assume that my imagination
was not far off the rails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but hang it, man,” said the Barrister,
peevishly, “the whole thing was a pure fluke on
your part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never laid any claim to being a
detective,” murmured the sandy-haired man,
mildly, rising and helping himself to some more
whisky. “All that I said was that there are times
when you can build an entire case from your half-brick
or its equivalent. And when you find
two glasses both smelling strongly of whisky
in a room, you assume that two people have
drunk whisky. Which was where the Corsican
tripped up. You see, he distinctly swore he
hadn’t entered the room till he came in with
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barrister raised protesting hands to the
ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is indubitably mad,” he remarked
to no one in particular. “Was not Fairfax in the
room most of the evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandy-haired man looked even more
mild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that perhaps I ought to have mentioned
one fact sooner, but I was afraid it would
spoil the story. The cat has an aversion to
water; the fish have an aversion to dry land.
But both these aversions pale into total
insignificance when compared to Jack Fairfax’s
aversion to whisky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed thoughtfully at his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A strange flaw in an otherwise fine character.
Thank heavens the symptom is not common!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“Yes</span>; she’s a beautiful woman. There’s no
doubt about that. What did you say her name
was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t mentioned her name,” I returned.
“But there’s no secret about it. She is Lady
Sylvia Clavering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Sylvia. Of course, I remember now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drained his glass of brandy and sat back in
his chair, while his eyes followed one of the most
beautiful women in London as she threaded her
way through the tables towards the entrance of
the restaurant. An obsequious head-waiter bent
almost double as she passed; her exit, as usual,
befitted one of the most be-photographed women
of Society. And it was not until the doors had
swung to behind her and her escort that the man
I had been dining with spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that little bow she gave as she passed
here was yours, not mine,” he said, with the
suspicion of a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presumably,” I answered a little curtly.
“Unless you happen to know her. I have that
privilege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His smile grew a trifle more pronounced though
his eyes were set and steady. “Know her?”
He beckoned to the waiter for more brandy.
“No, I can’t say I know her. In fact, my sole
claim to acquaintanceship is that I carried her for
three miles in the dark one night, slung over my
shoulder like a sack of potatoes. But I don’t
know her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did what?” I cried, staring at him in
amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds a bit over the odds, I admit.” He
was carefully cutting the end off his cigar.
“Nevertheless it stands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now when any man states that he has carried
a woman for three miles, whether it be in the dark
or not, and has followed up such an introduction
so indifferently that the woman fails even to
recognise him afterwards, there would seem to be
the promise of a story. But when the woman is
one of the Lady Sylvia Claverings of this world,
and the man is of the type of my dinner companion,
the promise resolves itself into a
certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton was one of those indefinable characters
who defy placing. You felt that if you landed in
Yokohama, and he was with you, you would
instinctively rely on him for information as to the
best thing to do and the best way to do it. There
seemed to be no part of the globe, from the
South Sea Islands going westward to Alaska,
with which he was not as well acquainted as the
ordinary man is with his native village. At the
time I did not know him well. The dinner
was only our third meeting, and during the meal
we confined ourselves to the business which had
been the original cause of our running across one
another at all. But even in that short time I had
realised that Billy Merton was a white man.
And not only was he straight, but he was essentially
a useful person to have at one’s side in a
tight corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you disposed to elaborate your somewhat
amazing statement?” I asked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two he hesitated, and his eyes
became thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose there’s any reason why I
shouldn’t,” he answered slowly. “It’s ancient
history now—ten years or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was just about the time she was
married,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “She was on her honeymoon
when it happened. Well, if you want to hear the
yarn, come round to my club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, certainly,” I said, beckoning for the
bill. “Let’s get on at once; I’m curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know Africa at all?” he asked me,
as we pulled our chairs up to the fire. We had
the room almost to ourselves; a gentle snoring
from the other fireplace betokened the only other
occupant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Egypt,” I answered. “Parts of South Africa.
The usual thing: nothing out of the ordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “It was up the West Coast that
it happened,” he began, after his pipe was going
to his satisfaction. “And though I’ve been in
many God-forsaken spots in my life, I’ve never
yet struck anything to compare with that place.
Nwambi it was called—just a few shacks stretching
in from the sea along a straggling, dusty
street—one so-called shop and a bar. It called
itself an hotel, but Lord help the person who tried
to put up there. It was a bar pure and simple,
though no one could call the liquor that. Lukewarm
gin, some vile substitute for whisky, the
usual short drinks, and some local poisons formed
the stock; I ought to know—I was the bartender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For about three miles inland there stretched
a belt of stinking swamp—one vast malaria
hot-bed—and over this belt the straggling street
meandered towards the low foot-hills beyond.
At times it almost lost itself: but if you didn’t
give up hope, or expire from the stench, and cast
about you’d generally find it again leading you
on to where you felt you might get a breath of
God’s fresh air in the hills. As a matter of fact
you didn’t; the utmost one can say is that it
wasn’t quite so appalling as in the swamp itself.
Mosquitoes! Heavens! they had to be seen
to be believed. I’ve watched ’em there literally
like a grey cloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That—and the eternal boom of the sea on the
bar half a mile out, made up Nwambi. How any
white man ever got through alive if he had to stop
there any length of time is beyond me; to be
accurate, very few did. It was a grave, that
place, and only the down-and-outers went there.
At the time I was one myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sole reason for its existence at all was
that the water alongside the quay was deep
enough for good-sized boats to come in, and most
of the native produce from the district inland
found its way down to Nwambi for shipment.
Once over the belt of swamp and a few miles into
the hills the climate was much better, and half a
dozen traders in a biggish way had bungalows
there. They were Dagos most of them—it
wasn’t a British part of the West Coast—and I
frankly admit that my love for the Dago has
never been very great. But there was one
Scotchman, McAndrew, amongst them—and he
was the first fellow who came into the bar after
I’d taken over the job. He was down for the
night about some question of freight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re new,’ he remarked, leaning against
the counter. ‘What’s happened to the other
fellow? Is he dead?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Probably,’ I returned. ‘What do you
want?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Gin—double tot. What’s your name?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him, and he pondered the matter while
he finished his drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ he said at length, ‘I warned your
predecessor, and I’ll warn you. Don’t fall foul
of my manager down here. Name of Mainwaring—I
do <span class='it'>not</span> think. Don’t give him advice about
keeping off the drink, or he’ll kill you. He’s
killing himself, but that’s his business. I’m
tough—you look tough, but he’s got us beat to a
frazzle. And take cover if he ever gets mixed
up with any of the Dagos—the place isn’t
healthy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was just at that moment that the door
swung open and a tall, lean fellow lounged in.
He’d got an eyeglass screwed into one eye, and a
pair of perfectly-fitting polo boots with some
immaculate white breeches encased his legs. His
shirt was silk, his sun-helmet spotless; in fact,
he looked like the typical English dude of fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My manager, Mainwaring,’ said McAndrew,
by way of introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mainwaring stared at me for a moment or
two—then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You look sane; however, if you come here
you can’t be. Double gin—and one for yourself.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He spoke with a faint, almost affected drawl,
and as I poured out the drinks I watched him
covertly. When he first came in I had thought
him a young man; now I wasn’t so sure. It was
his eyes that made one wonder as to his age—they
were so utterly tired. If he was indeed drinking
himself to death, there were no traces of it as
yet on his face, and his hand as he lifted his
glass was perfectly steady. But those eyes of
his—I can see them now. The cynical bitterness,
the concentrated weariness of all Hell was
in them. And it’s not good for any man to look
like that; certainly not a man of thirty-five, as
I afterwards discovered his age to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton paused and sipped his whisky-and-soda,
while from the other side of the room came
indications that the sleeper still slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never found out what his real name was,”
he continued, thoughtfully. “Incidentally, it
doesn’t much matter. We knew him as Mainwaring,
and the J. which preceded it in his signature
was assumed to stand for James or Jimmy.
Anyway, he answered to it, which was the main
point. As far as I know, he never received a
letter and he never read a paper, and I guess I
got to know him better than anyone else in that
hole. Every morning, punctual to the second at
eleven o’clock, he’d stroll into the bar and have
three double-gins. Sometimes he’d talk in his
faint, rather pleasant drawl; more often he’d sit
silently at one of the rickety tables, staring out to
sea, with his long legs stretched out in front of
him. But whichever he did—whatever morning
it was—you could always see your face in his
boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember once, after I’d been there about a
month, I started to pull his leg about those boots
of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Take the devil of a long time cleaning
them in the morning, don’t you, Jimmy?’ I
said, as he lounged up to the bar for his third
gin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ he answered, leaning over the counter
so that his face was close to mine. ‘Got anything
further to say about my appearance?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jimmy,’ I replied, ‘your appearance doesn’t
signify one continental damn to me. But as the
only two regular British <span class='it'>habitués</span> of this first-class
American bar, don’t let’s quarrel.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He grinned—a sort of slow, lazy grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Think not?’ he said. ‘Might amuse one.
However, perhaps you’re right.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so it went on—one sweltering day after
another, until one could have gone mad with the
hideous boredom of it. I used to stand behind
the bar there sometimes and curse weakly and
foolishly like a child, but I never heard Mainwaring
do it. What happened during those
steamy nights in the privacy of his own room,
when he—like the rest of us—was fighting for
sleep, is another matter. During the day he
never varied. Cold, cynical, immaculate, he
seemed a being apart—above our little worries
and utterly contemptuous of them. Maybe he
was right—maybe the thing that had downed him
was too big for foolish cursing. Knowing what
I do now, a good many things are clear which one
didn’t realise at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only once, I think, did I ever get in the
slightest degree intimate with him. It was latish
one evening, and the bar was empty save for us
two. I’d been railing against the fate that had
landed me penniless in such an accursed spot,
and after a while he chipped in, in his lazy
drawl:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Would a thousand be any good to you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked at him speechless. ‘A thousand
pounds?’ I stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes; I think I can raise that for you.’
He was staring in front of him as he spoke.
‘And yet I don’t know. I’ve got more or less
used to you and you’ll have to stop a bit longer.
Then we’ll see about it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But, good heavens! man,’ I almost shouted,
‘do you mean to say that you stop here when you
can lay your hand on a thousand pounds?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It appears so, doesn’t it?’ He rose and
stalked over to the bar. ‘It doesn’t much matter
where you stop, Merton, when you can’t be in the
one place where you’d sell your hopes of Heaven
to be. And it’s best, perhaps, to choose a place
where the end will come quickly.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With that he turned on his heel, and I
watched him with a sort of dazed amazement as
he sauntered down the dusty road, white in the
tropical moon, towards his own shack. A
thousand pounds! The thought of it rang in
my head all through the night. A thousand
pounds! A fortune! And because, out in
death-spots like that, men are apt to think
strange thoughts—thoughts that look ugly by the
light of day—I found myself wondering how long
he could last at the rate he was going. Two—sometimes
three—bottles of gin a day: it
couldn’t be long. And then—who knew? It
would be quick, the break-up; all the quicker
because there was not a trace of it now. And
perhaps when it came he’d remember about that
thousand. Or I could remind him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton laughed grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’re pretty average swine, even the
best of us, when we’re up against it, and I lay no
claims to be a plaster saint. But Fate had
decreed that Jimmy Mainwaring was to find the
end which he craved for quicker than he had
anticipated. Moreover—and that’s what I’ve
always been glad about—it had decreed that he
was to find it before drink had rotted that iron
constitution of his; while his boots still shone
and his silk shirts remained spotless. It had
decreed that he was to find it in the way of all
others that he would have chosen, had such a wild
improbability ever suggested itself. Which is
going ahead a bit fast with the yarn—but no
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was after I’d been there about three
months that the incident happened which was
destined to be the indirect cause of his death. I
told you, didn’t I, that there were several Dago
traders who lived up in the foot-hills, and on the
night in question three of them had come down
to Nwambi on business of some sort—amongst
them one Pedro Salvas, who was as unpleasant
a specimen of humanity as I have ever met.
A crafty, orange-skinned brute, who indulged,
according to common knowledge, in every known
form of vice, and a good many unknown ones too.
The three of them were sitting at a table near the
door when Mainwaring lounged in—and McAndrew’s
words came back to me. The Dagos
had been drinking; Jimmy looked in his most
uncompromising mood. He paused at the door,
and stared at each of them in turn through his
eyeglass; then he turned his back on them and
came over to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I glanced over his shoulder at the three men,
and realised there was trouble coming. They’d
been whispering and muttering together the whole
evening, though at the time I had paid no
attention. But now Pedro Salvas, with an ugly
flush on his ugly face, had risen and was coming
towards the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If one so utterly unworthy as I,’ he
snarled, ‘may venture to speak to the so very
exclusive Englishman, I would suggest that he
does not throw pictures of his lady-loves about
the streets.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was holding something in his hand, and
Jimmy swung round like a panther. His hand
went to his breast pocket; then I saw what the
Dago was holding out. It was the miniature of a
girl. And after that I didn’t see much more;
I didn’t even have time to take cover. It
seemed to me that the lightning movement of
Jimmy’s left hand as he grabbed the miniature,
and the terrific upper-cut with his right, were
simultaneous. Anyway, the next second he was
putting the picture back in his breast pocket,
and the Dago, snarling like a mad dog, was
picking himself out of a medley of broken bottles.
That was phase one. Phase two was equally
rapid, and left me blinking. There was the crack
of a revolver, and at the same moment a knife
stuck out quivering in the wall behind my head.
Then there was a silence, and I collected my
scattered wits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The revolver, still smoking, was in Jimmy’s
hand: Salvas, his right arm dripping with
blood, was standing by the door, while his two
pals were crouching behind the table, looking
for all the world like wild beasts waiting to
spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Next time,’ said Jimmy, ‘I shoot to kill.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he meant it. He was a bit white round
the nostrils, which is a darned dangerous sign
in a man, especially if he’s got a gun and you’re
looking down the business end of it. And no one
knew it better than those three Dagos. They
went on snarling, but not one of them moved an
eyelid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Put your knives on that table, you scum,’
ordered Jimmy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other two obeyed, and he laughed
contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now clear out. You pollute the air.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment or two they hesitated: then
Salvas, with a prodigious effort, regained his
self-control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are brave, Señor Mainwaring, when you
have a revolver and we are unarmed,’ he said,
with a sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In two strides Jimmy was at the table where
the knives were lying. He picked one up, threw
me his gun, and pointed to the other knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll fight you now, Salvas,’ he answered,
quietly. ‘Knife to knife, and to a finish.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Dago wasn’t taking any, and ’pon
my soul I hardly blamed him. For if ever a man
was mad, Jimmy Mainwaring was mad that
night: mad with the madness that knows no
fear and is absolutely blind to consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not brawl in bars with drunken Englishmen,’
remarked Salvas, turning on his heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A magnificent utterance, but ill-advised with
Jimmy as he was. He gave a short laugh and
took a running kick, and Don Pedro Salvas
disappeared abruptly into the night. And the
other two followed with celerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’ll be getting into trouble, old man,’
I said, as he came back to the bar, ‘if you start
that sort of game with the Dagos.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The bigger the trouble the more I’ll like it,’
he answered, shortly. ‘Give me another drink.
Don’t you understand yet, Merton, that I’m
beyond caring?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thinking it over since, I’ve come to the
conclusion that he spoke the literal truth. It’s
a phrase often used, and very rarely meant;
in his case it was the plain, unvarnished truth.
Rightly or wrongly he had got into such a condition
that he cared not one fig whether he lived
or died; if anything he preferred the latter.
And falling foul of the Dago colony was a better
way than most of obtaining his preference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, the episode that night had shown
me one thing: it was a woman who was at the
bottom of it all. I didn’t ask any questions;
he wasn’t a man who took kindly to cross-examination.
But I realised pretty forcibly that
if the mere handling of her picture by a Dago
had produced such a result, the matter must be
serious. Who she was I hadn’t any idea, or what
was the trouble between them—and, as I say,
I didn’t ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then one day a few weeks later I got
the answer to the first question. Someone left
a month-old <span class='it'>Tatler</span> in the bar, and I was glancing
through it when Mainwaring came in. I
reached up for the gin bottle to give him his usual
drink, and when I turned round to hand it to him
he was staring at one of the pictures with the
look of a dead man on his face. I can see him
now with his knuckles gleaming white through the
sunburn of his hands, and his great powerful
chest showing under his shirt. He stood like
that maybe for five minutes—motionless; then,
without a word, he swung round and left the bar.
And I picked up the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton paused and drained his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Sylvia’s wedding?” I asked, unnecessarily,
and he nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the first part of the riddle was solved,”
he continued, quietly. “And when two days
passed by without a sign of Mainwaring, I began
to be afraid that he had solved his own riddle in
his own way. But he hadn’t; he came into the
bar at ten o’clock at night, and leaned up against
the counter in his usual way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What have you been doing with yourself?’
I said, lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ve been trying to get drunk,’ he answered
slowly, letting one of his hands fall on my arm
with a grip like steel. ‘And, dear God! I can’t.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t sound much—told like this in the
smoking-room of a London club. But though
I’ve seen and heard many things in my life that
have impressed me—horrible, dreadful things
that I shall never forget—the moment of all
others that is most indelibly stamped on my
brain is that moment when, leaning across the
bar, I looked into the depths of the soul of the
man who called himself Jimmy Mainwaring—the
man who could not get drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again he paused, and this time I did not
interrupt him. He was back in that steaming
night, with the smell of stale spirits in his nostrils
and the sight of strange things in his eyes. And
I felt that I, too, could visualise that tall,
immaculate Englishman leaning against the
counter—the man who was beyond caring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must get on with it,” continued Merton,
after a while. “The club will be filling up soon
and I’ve only got the finish to tell you now.
And by one of those extraordinary coincidences
which happen far more frequently in life than
people will allow, the finish proved a worthy
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was about two days later. I was in the
bar polishing the glasses when the door swung
open and two men came in. They were obviously
English, and both of them were dressed as if they
were going to a garden-party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thank heavens! Tommy, here’s a bar, at
any rate,’ said one of them. ‘I say, barman,
what have you got?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I had a bit of a liver, and I disliked
being called barman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Several bottles of poison,’ I answered, ‘and
the hell of a temper.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second one laughed, and after a moment
or two the other joined in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t wonder at the latter commodity,’
he said. ‘This is a ghastly hole.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I wouldn’t deny it,’ I answered. ‘What,
if I may ask, has brought you here?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, we’ve had a small breakdown, and the
skipper came in here to repair it. We’ve just
come ashore to have a look round.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I glanced through the window, and noticed
for the first time that a steam yacht was lying
off the shore. She was a real beauty—looked
about a thousand tons—and I gave a sigh of
envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re not in want of a barman, by any
chance, are you?’ I said. ‘If so, I’ll swim out
and chance the sharks.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘ ’Fraid we’ve got everything in that line,’
he answered. ‘But select the least deadly of
your poisons, and join us.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was as I was pulling down the gin and
vermouth that Jimmy Mainwaring came into the
bar. He got about half-way across the floor,
and then he stopped dead in his tracks. And I
guess during the next two seconds you could have
heard a pin drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So this is where you’ve hidden yourself,’
said the smaller of the two men—the one who had
done most of the talking. ‘I don’t think we’ll
trouble you for those drinks, barman.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without another word he walked out of the
place—and after a moment or two the other man
started to follow him. He hesitated as he got
abreast of Jimmy, and then for the first time
Mainwaring spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is she here?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ answered the other. ‘On board the
yacht. There’s a whole party of us.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with that he stepped into the street and
joined his pal. With a perfectly inscrutable
look on his face Jimmy watched them as they
walked through the glaring sun and got into the
small motor-boat that was waiting alongside the
quay. Then he came up to the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘An artistic touch, doubtless, on the part
of Fate,’ he remarked, quietly. ‘But a little
unnecessary.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I guess I metaphorically took off my hat
to him at that moment. What he’d done, why
he was there, I neither knew nor cared; all that
mattered to me was the way he took that last
rotten twist of the surgeon’s knife. Not by the
quiver of an eyelid would you have known that
anything unusual had happened: he drank his
three double-gins at exactly the same rate as
every other morning. And then he too swung out
of the bar, and went back to his office in McAndrew’s
warehouse, leaving me to lie down on
my bed and sweat under the mosquito curtains,
while I wondered at the inscrutable working out
of things. Was it blind, the Fate that moved
the pieces; or was there some definite pattern
beyond our ken? At the moment it seemed
pretty blind and senseless; later on—well,
you’ll be able to form your own opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know how quickly darkness falls in
those latitudes. And it was just before sunset
that I saw a boat shoot away from the side of the
yacht and come full speed for the shore. I
remember I wondered casually who was the mug
who would leave a comfortable yacht for Nwambi,
especially after the report of it that must have
been given by our two morning visitors. And
then it struck me that, whoever it might be, he
was evidently in the deuce of a hurry. Almost
before the boat came alongside a man sprang out
and scrambled up the steps. Then at a rapid
double he came sprinting towards me as I stood
at the door of the bar. It was the smaller of the
two men who had been ashore that morning, and
something was evidently very much amiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where is she?’ he shouted, as soon as he
came within earshot. ‘Where’s my wife, you
damned scoundrel?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seeing that he was quite beside himself with
worry and alarm, I let the remark go by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Steady!’ I said, as he came gasping up to
me. ‘I haven’t got your wife; I haven’t even
seen her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s that card-sharper!’ he cried. ‘By
God! I’ll shoot him like a dog, if he’s tried any
monkey-tricks!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dry up, and pull yourself together,’ I said
angrily. ‘If you’re alluding to Jimmy Mainwaring——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at that moment Jimmy himself stepped
out of his office and strolled across the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You swine, you cursed card-cheat—where’s
Sylvia?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What the devil are you talking about?’
said Jimmy, and his voice was tense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘She came ashore this afternoon, saying she
would return in an hour,’ said the other man. ‘I
didn’t know it at the time, Mr.—er—Mainwaring,
I believe you call yourself. The boat came back
for her, and she was not there. That was four
hours ago. Where is she?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was covering Jimmy with his revolver
as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Four hours ago, Clavering! Good heavens!
man—put down your gun. This isn’t a time for
amateur theatricals.’ He brushed past him as
if he was non-existent and came up to me. ‘Did
you see Lady Clavering?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not a trace,’ I answered, and the same fear
was in both of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did she say what she was coming on shore
for?’ He swung round on the husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To have a look round,’ answered Clavering,
and his voice had altered. No longer was he the
outraged husband; he was a frightened man
relying instinctively on a bigger personality than
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If she’s not about here, she must have gone
inland,’ said Jimmy, staring at me. ‘And it’ll
be dark in five minutes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My God!’ cried Clavering, ‘what are we
to do? She can’t be left alone for the night.
Lost—in this cursed country! She may have
hurt herself—sprained her ankle.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a moment neither of us answered him.
Even more than he did we realise the hideous
danger of a white woman alone in the bush inland.
There were worse dangers than snakes and wild
animals to be feared. And it was as we were
standing there staring at one another, and afraid
to voice our thoughts, that one of McAndrew’s
native boys came down the street. He was
running and out of breath; and the instant he
saw Jimmy he rushed up to him and started
gabbling in the local patois. He spoke too fast
for me to follow him, and Clavering, of course,
couldn’t understand a word. But we both
guessed instinctively what he was talking about
and we both watched Jimmy’s face. And as we
watched it I heard Clavering catch his breath
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last the boy finished, and Jimmy turned
and looked at me. On his face was a look of such
cold malignant fury that the question which was
trembling on my lips died away, and I stared at
him speechlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The Dagos have got her,’ he said, very softly.
‘Don Pedro Salvas is, I fear, a foolish man.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clavering gave a sort of hoarse cry, and
Jimmy’s face softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Poor devil,’ he said. ‘Your job is going to
be harder than mine. Go back to your yacht—get
all your men on shore that you can spare—and
if I’m not back in four hours, wait for dawn
and then strike inland over the swamp. Find
Pedro Salvas’s house—and hang him on the
highest tree you can find.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without another word he swung on his heel
and went up the street at a long, steady lope.
Twice Clavering called after him, but he never
turned his head or altered his stride—and then
he started to follow himself. It was I who
stopped him, and he cursed me like a child—almost
weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do what he told you,’ I said. ‘You’d never
find your way; you’d be worse than useless.
I’ll go with him: you get back and bring your
men ashore.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with that I followed Jimmy. At times
I could see him, a faint white figure in the darkness,
as he dodged through that fever-laden
swamp; at times I found myself marvelling at
the condition of the man, bearing in mind his
method of living. Steadily, tirelessly, he forged
ahead, and when he came to the foot-hills I
hadn’t gained a yard on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I began wondering what was going
to happen when he reached Salvas’s bungalow,
and by what strange mischance the girl had met
the owner. That it was revenge I was certain;
he had recognised her from the picture, and I
remember thinking how bitter must have been his
hatred of Mainwaring to have induced him to run
such an appalling risk. For the risk was appalling,
even in that country of strange happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think that Jimmy troubled his head
over any such speculations. In his mind there
was room for only one thought—an all-sufficient
thought—to get his hands on Pedro Salvas. I
don’t think he even knew that I was behind him,
until after it was over and the curtain was falling
on the play. And then he had no time for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton gave a short laugh that had in it a
touch of sadness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good curtain it was, too,” he continued,
quietly. “I remember I made a frantic endeavour
to overtake him as he raced up to the
house, and then, because I just couldn’t help
myself, I stopped and watched—fascinated.
The window of the big living-room was open, and
the light blazed out. I suppose they had never
anticipated pursuit that night. Leaning up
against the wall was the girl, with a look of frozen
horror on her face, while seated at the table
were Pedro Salvas and three of his pals. And
they were drinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all happened very quickly. For one
second I saw Jimmy Mainwaring framed in the
window—then he began shooting. I don’t think
I’ve mentioned that he could shoot the pip out
of the ace of diamonds nine times out of ten at
twenty yards, and his madness did not interfere
with his aim. And that night he was stark,
staring mad. I heard three shots—so close
together that only an artist could have fired
them out of the same revolver and taken aim;
I saw the three friends of Pedro Salvas collapse
limply in their chairs. And then there was a
pause; I think Jimmy wanted to get at <span class='it'>him</span>
with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was not to be. Just for a moment the
owner of the bungalow had been so stupefied at
the sudden appearance of the man he hated that
he had simply sat still, staring; but only for a
moment. The movement of his arm was so quick
that I hardly saw it; I only noticed what seemed
to be a streak of light which shot across the room.
And then I heard Jimmy’s revolver again—the
tenth, the hundredth of a second too late. He’d
drilled Pedro Salvas through the heart all right—I
watched the swine crumple and fall with the
snarl still on his face—but this time the knife
wasn’t sticking in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She got to him first,” went on Merton,
thoughtfully. “His knees were sagging just
as I got to the window, and she was trying to hold
him up in her arms. And then between us we
laid him down, and I saw that the end was very
near. There was nothing I could do; the knife
was clean into his chest. The finish of the
journey had come to the man who could not get
drunk. And so I left them together, while I
mounted guard by the window with a gun in each
hand. It wasn’t a house to take risks in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lived, I think, for five minutes, and of
those five minutes I would rather not speak.
There are things which a man may tell, and things
which he may not. Sufficient be it to say that
he may have cheated at cards or he may not—she
loved him. If, indeed, he had committed the
unforgivable sin amongst gentlemen all the world
over, he atoned for it. And she loved him. Let
us leave it at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when it was over, and the strange, bitter
spirit of the man who called himself Jimmy Mainwaring
had gone out on the unknown road, I
touched her on the shoulder. She rose blindly
and stumbled out into the darkness at my side.
I don’t think I spoke a word to her, beyond telling
her to take my arm. And after a while she grew
heavier and heavier on it, until at last she slipped
down—a little unconscious heap of sobbing
girlhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton paused and lit a cigarette with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that is how it was ordained that I should
carry the Lady Sylvia Clavering, slung over my
shoulder like a sack of potatoes, for three miles.
I remember staggering into the village to find
myself surrounded by men from the yacht. I
handed her over to her distracted husband, and
then I rather think I fainted myself. I know I
found myself in my own bar, with people pouring
whisky down my throat. And after a while they
cleared off, leaving Clavering alone with me. He
began to stammer out his thanks, and I cut him
short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No thanks are due to me,’ I said. ‘They’re
due to another man whom you called a card-cheat—but
who was a bigger man than either
you or I are ever likely to be.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Was?’ he said, staring at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ I answered. ‘He’s dead.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stood there silently for a moment or two;
then with a queer look on his face he took off his
hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’re right,’ he said. ‘He was a bigger
man than me.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merton got up and pressed the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never seen him from that day to this,”
he said, thoughtfully. “I never saw his wife
again until to-night. And I’ve never filled in the
gaps in the story. Moreover, I don’t know that
I want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A waiter came over to his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll join me? Two whiskies-and-sodas,
please, waiter—large ones.”</p>
